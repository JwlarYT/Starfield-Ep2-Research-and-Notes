Sleepcrate home was added during COVID (VO audio difference).

Further disconnect between [Level_Design](Level_Design.md) team and [Writing](Writing.md) team - Euphorika's owner says that the members lounge is ‘down below’, but it’s upstairs, not in the basement.

[World_Building](World_Building.md) - Overall theme of the game is hope in the face of adversity. From the MQ, to some of the factions, and even random encounters, humanity will always try to progress and grow. Whether in expanding in space or helping their fellow man. The story between the owner of the Euphorika and a Street Rat she helped off the streets embodies that.

Gang fight in Euphroika was very anticlimactic. The gangs should be set as factions imo, so that other members now attack me. I killed a named member of the Disciple gang, but others in Ebbside don't care.
	A man warned me about the Disciples gang and how they’re so much worse than the Striker gang. I have yet to see any since I took out two of them in Euphorika. What a scary bunch of lads.
