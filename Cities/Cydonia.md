Mining town. Conveniently still exists as lore lines form crowd mention they are surprised that they’re still finding new deposits.
Red dusts causes red eyes, foundation for cool name of SpecOps team for UC in colony war. War crimes abound.

Cydonia exterior - Hand-made locations can be extremely visually impressive, especially with their massive scale, and it’s a reminder of Bethesda’s previous strengths. 

NPCS are going about their business, even a random one with some interesting dialogue about how they hate their job. The low gravity and jet pack make the exploration intrinsically motivating, and I would even go so far as to say fun, just for the novelty of it. This is an instance where the competition is NOT doing this - NMS doesn’t have densely packed locations like this, for example. It’s one of the few times the game feels truly ‘next-gen’ and where I can make a concession for separating a city's interior from its exterior. The outside is so full of assets and clutter, I can let them off a little bit for separating the cells. Not many games outside of Rockstar and CD Projekt Red titles have a comparable level of detail without loading zones.

Bugs still hinder this otherwise pleasing experience, such as Z-clipping on certain surfaces, even when viewed up close. 

Cydonia Tavern - I must say, the crowd density at times is [immersive](immersion.md). It isn’t Night City, but there’s a semblance of life here. What’s missing is the hustle and bustle. NPCS walk around, get a drink and sit together, but they only talk to the player, and otherwise pretend to have a conversation. Getting close reveals, however, that they are just set pieces. Where is the campsite chatter of RDR or the random banter of KCD?

The Broken Spear bar on Mars’s Cydonia station fits a classic space-western trope—a frontier town saloon where miners, wanderers, and drifters gather. Likely named for its symbolic resonance—a broken weapon = peace, rest, or end of conflict.
- A metaphorical break from violence, a spot to lay down your arms
That atmosphere is exactly what you experience inside: a gritty bar run by Jack, selling straightforward drinks to straight-talking patrons and operating as a hub for story characters like Andromeda Kepler and Moara Otero
in medieval heraldry, a broken spear (or lance) is commonly interpreted as a symbol of peace—it’s the weapon cast aside after battle—or sometimes as a sign of death or the end of struggle
