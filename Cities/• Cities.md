#### [[New Atlantis]]
UC is British empire / Imperials in Star Wars. In NA you get to see the propaganda and prosperity (as well as class divide) that that brings. Slow, rigid, uniform, authoritarian and sacrifices personal liberty for stability.
#### [[Cydonia]]
Mining town. Conveniently still exists as lore lines form crowd mention they are surprised that they’re still finding new deposits.
Red dusts causes red eyes, foundation for cool name of SpecOps team for UC in colony war. War crimes abound.
#### [[Akila City]]
Frontier town, the American’s that defeated the British (or tried to in this case). Ran away due to disagreement with UC government to form their own society based on freedom and not conforming to government mandates. (UC requires all to work for the Gov as military or scientists to get citizenship, it is not a birth right)
#### [[Neon City]]
Las Vegas. Ran by crime boss. Seedy and extreme wealth. Built on a product that is illegal elsewhere (gambling irl / Aurora in Neon), based in America (Freestar). But Freestar have little presence and local police force is in the pocket of the main corpo overlord. Oligarch's run the city.
#### [[New Homestead]]
Salem. Historical town that exists for lore and tourism. Where humans first went and testEd the NASA settlements.
#### [[Gargarin]]
80s Detroit. Built on Mech industry that has now left, but the abstract poverty and crime hasn't quite hit yet. Instead most have already left, analogous of people leaving their small hometowns to work in the big cities.
#### [[Paradiso]]
Holiday resort. Mexico to the Americans and Spain to the Brits. People who want to escape the hustle and bustle and don’t much care for the locals that have a claim on the land (in this case a colony ship whose claim is outdated - what did they mean by this lol )
#### [[Red Mile]]
The Running Man. Literally the Running Man.
#### [[The Key]]
Australia. Prisoners sent to a barren wasteland to die, broke free and formed a criminal society. UC use shadow ops SysDef to try and take them out. Most don’t know they were once UC citizen criminals. 
#### [[HopeTown]]
A company town.


You can transition between a bustling city filled with 40+ npcs milling about, right into the wilderness without any loading screen - like in Morrowind, before the instanced cities in Oblivion.
	Being able to run/boost from the city into the wilderness with no instance changing/loading screen is very impressive for the engine. They have finally overcome that limitation fix seen in Oblivion. This is great news for TES6.
