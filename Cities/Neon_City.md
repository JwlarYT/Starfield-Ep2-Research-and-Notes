Las Vegas in premise but with a Cyberpunk Tokyo aesthetic. Ran by a crime boss. Seedy and extreme wealth. Built on a product that is illegal elsewhere (gambling irl / Aurora in Neon), based in the 'American West' (Freestar). But Freestar have little presence, and the local police force is in the pocket of the main corporate/criminal overlord. Oligarchs run the city.

##### Starfield: Location Insights (Developer Commentary) - Neon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2io6xFD1VY
27 Aug 2021, Bethesda Softworks

- Nothing of note in the video other than the dialogue is as chopped up as the aurora dialogue in-game. Shouldn't throw stones in glass houses though, I do the same.

A sci-fi Tokyo cyberpunk-inspired metropolis placed atop an Oil Rig on a planet drowned in water. Bethesda is again proving that they can come up with great ideas on paper, as good as the best of them. Only the execution is where it all falls apart. Too small, essentially a town.

Seokguh = Yakuza.

The [city](Cities/Neon_City.md) that lives as a fish harvesting oil rig on a planet full of water doesn't even have boats

Neshar encounter when approaching the elevator - Sniffers? 
Were there meant to be alien-type-dogs here, or real dogs before they were removed with new lore? 
I can fill this in with headcanon, considering sniffers as a name for the scanners, a colloquial term that harkens back to a time when real dogs were used, but that isn’t clear. 
I’ll admit that I’m reading way too much into this bit, though. Other guards call these scanners too, not sniffers. Maybe that other guy is just a weirdo? Or it's another result of [Poor_Planning](Development/Poor_Planning.md)

More NPC awareness in [Dialogue](Writing/Dialogue.md) would be appreciated. The receptionist at Ryujin insisted that I check out the Neuromap store, even though I was already wearing one. 
NPCs *can* recognise this because another guard commented on me wearing it. These minor discrepancies, when isolated, are acceptable, but over time, they once again harm [Immersion](Presentation/Immersion.md). KCD1 and 2 *do* have this level of dialogue variance, for example.

So many [Side_Quests](../Side_Quests/Side_Quests.md) feel like minor filler, especially in Neon. Hand out these flyers, talk to this one guy to fix our disagreement. 
	^ I must come back after a few in-game days to see if there has been a result of these quests. Although knowing Bethesda game design, they would’ve left the quest open, saying “come back in a few days” if that was the case. In KCD or FNV I would expect a change, so let's give them the benefit of the doubt.
		^ I came back. There’s some flavour text thanking the player, but not much else. It’s something at least. I don’t think these minor activity quests are too bad. They exist so that the player can feel like they’re helping out the local populace - ala Fallout New Vegas et al. 
		I just wish there was some follow-up in the Unity end sequence. FNV provides us with the rundown on what happened to the locals of each town, and Starfield badly needed that to add an extra level of care to the cities. There’s only 9 anyway, so it’s not like it would be *too* much work.

### Trader Tower
The Tower where Stroud’s company has its offices also holds many others, so it only felt natural to check them out too. 
#### Kore Kinetics 
Manufacture the Mag-Tech (railgun) guns that look like a kid K’nex wet dream. Apparently, they fire projectiles faster than a conventional gun and can pierce through solid concrete, which of course isn’t possible in game. No such material penetration exists like in pure shooter. 
	Even ship ladders are able to block a projectile with thin air. 

The guns are even goofier as they all fire in an array, akin to a shotgun but with a controlled spread. This limits their effectiveness to close to medium range, which has them going head-to-head with shotties from a [Advanced_Combat](../Gameplay_Systems/Advanced_Combat.md) perspective. 
	Personally, I never quite felt like they had the punch I was looking for, partly due to their [Sound_Design](Presentation/Sound_Design.md), which is expectedly weak, but probably realistic.

#### Generdyne Industries 
Created the electromagnetic Conduction Grid that powers Neon through the collection of lightning into storage cells. 
[World_Building](Writing/World_Building.md) - Population count in Starfield is extremely low compared to Earth, and appears to be Lore implied, and not a technical reason as in previous TES games. 
Generdyne, for example, has an executive suite member manning its reception desk. 
	Realistically, though, I’m sure the reason for this is so the player is far more likely to interact with this unique NPC than had they been hidden away in the backroom with the other generic NPC employees and executives.
	
He asked me for help regarding a case of corporate nepotism, where Administrator Bayu (owner of the Tower and governmental big-dog on Neon) has hired his brother to head the R&D team for the city's powergrid firm. 
His ideas have lost the company a tonne of money and he suppresses the other members of the R&D team out of ego. 
Ji Nashida (the receptionist/executive) has written up a report on R&D Bayu’s failures and is asking whether we think he should send it to the administrator. The risk being that family ties will cloud the judgement. I told him to send it, but fully expect he will be fired. 
	^Need to come back here after this MQ quest to see what happened.

#### Celt Corp 
Again, has a high-level employee on the front desk - the CEO’s daughter. 
This one is more believable as he wants her to learn all about the business before she takes over, and she’s there to present ‘a pretty face for potential clients’ (her words). 
Celt Corp is apparently a ‘megacorp’, but it only has 10 visible employees in a small office, and I have never seen anything about them anywhere else in the game. I don’t even know what they do. <- They’re a loan shark!

Clover/Chloe has an issue with some debt for the man who owns the Mining League (the one who asked us to hand out flyers to form a shopping union), so I assume that they either rent the location to him, or supply the resources to this store.
	^ Did the Hard Luck [Side_Quests](../Side_Quests/Side_Quests.md)quest from this. Sadly just another run to one person, talk and then return type quest. 
		Multiple options in quests are cool, but less so when they are spoon-fed to the player. We can use Chloe’s diary to circumnavigate the persuasion needed on Saburo Okadigbo. For a game whose entire premise is NG+, this would have been cool to discover organically through exploration. 
		Instead, we are given a quest marker with an [Optional] tag. The diary isn’t even marked as stolen. 
			Where is the creativity in telling the player everything? Unique quest outcomes don’t feel earned when the roadmap is made evident.

#### Xenofresh
Not a lot to say about Xenofresh at this point other than it is the manufacturer of Aurora, the biggest corporation on Neon (with manufacturing in the Underbelly) and the source of Administrator Bayu’s wealth and power. Based on how curt the voice line selection is at this time, I must assume a larger Neon plot point or [•Factions](Factions/•Factions.md) questline uses this firm.

+ Related [Side_Quests](../Side_Quests/Side_Quests.md) - Yannick wants me to join Xenofresh to smuggle Aurora. I can literally leave the [Astral_Lounge](Locations/Astral_Lounge.md) with the stuff and no-one bats an eye. Seems like smuggling is hardly necessary. 
		Fair enough, it’s expensive from the Lounge though, so making our own batch at Xenofresh is probably better for profit margins. Also he could try and get an arrangement with Bayu like Euphorika did, but he hates Bayu’s guts so that probably wouldn’t fly. I would still have liked the option to ask him about it though.

#### Slayton Aerospace 
Not even trying to hide that it is a dungeon/stealth section even when we have no quest to make it so. 
he security is marked as an enemy, the receptionist, despite being named, has no dialogue and it is by far the biggest office in the tower with actual things to do. 

I was even able to grab whatever I needed for the quest here (a key and elevator override) without anything negative happening, as the quest hadn't been started. I was also able to stop an enemy guard from noticing me by closing a door - again NPCs marked as hostile seem to really struggle with these. 
	Rare occasion where the game accounts for this.

Other guards are not marked this way (with a level and health bar above their name) unless they are made hostile through crime. BGS weren’t even trying to hide what this was. Reminiscent of the guards being enemy knights in Daggerfall - where I could defend that as a time issue or technical issue, with 23 years of better tech and 6 times the development time, said defence does not hold up here. 

At least the elevator I overrode is still locked, so that I couldn’t break the quest, so there’s that I guess.
	But it also does not let me have a more uniqiue outcome. Like peneratrating Slayton before we needed too and taking out the CEO. Essenetially streamlining the following main quest mission - [All_That_Money_Can_Buy](../Main_Quest/All_That_Money_Can_Buy.md). New Vegas would've let us do that.

#### StraussEkland
Indoor spaces are consistently truncated, with no in-game indication of a bigger size. How do StraussEkland perform their many meetings (that Strauss and Eklund flirt about) with no conference room? At least put in an unopenable door to imply a larger office beyond the playable space. Some would complain about this, but it's better than having to imagine the increased space.

Strauss and Eklund are business and romantic partners who express their love through corporate mindgame. Strange, but endearing in a way. The player is sent to scout out the meeting spot in the lounge and learn more about the buyer from a contact - James Newill, the man we helped with a simple ‘go here to and talk’ quest.
