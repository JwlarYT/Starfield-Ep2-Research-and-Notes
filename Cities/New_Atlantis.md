##### [Starfield: Location Insights (Developer Commentary) - New Atlantis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoZAAebhnxs)

Emil Pagliarulo:
"What you’re looking at here is the city of New Atlantis. the capital city of the United Colonies, or U.C., is the most powerful, established military and political faction in the game. The city is a true melting pot and its residents come from every race, creed, and ethnicity. In a lot of ways, New Atlantis is a true reflection of the future of our world.

The underbelly of New Atlantis, “[The_Well](The_Well.md)” is far more interesting than the overworld. Better to explore and more enticing due to its seediness vs. the overall clean corporate aesthetic of the richer areas.

Some merchants and businesses in New Atlantis feel… [rushed](Poor_Planning.md). A golden art deco store that apparently sells the ‘best guns and gear in the solar system’ only had a crappy pistol in stock. And it is impossible to rob the store also. No inventory is held there, and there is no way to access a back room (the door doesn’t even exist).

Compare to Skyrim, where a smith will have gear hanging on the walls, on his table, and in a chest. The building in Starfield has none of that, just a grand yet empty room with a single employee. 

It’s a believable “lived in” world (TES) vs. something that feels like a game (Starfield).

SSNN only had a single employee too (conveniently a quest giver), with no sign of any way to actually access any offices, despite this being the “biggest news network in the galaxy”. 

3 security guards stand outside just to protect a single person. Another office building has the same problem, yet the next one suddenly has an elevator that lets you explore the offices. 

Why do only a few businesses have a sense of being “real” ? I’m not asking for them to all have an explorable back room, they just need to have an inaccessible elevator that can let your brain understand that there must be more levels, we’re just not allowed to go there. 

As it is, we have to believe that the ‘best’ Spacesuit store in the city has a single employee who pulls all the stock out of his ass. He's also never been to space, so perhaps this explains how terrible this store is, despite the couple outside explaiign how trendy and cool the outfits are.

[New_Atlantis](New_Atlantis.md) feels rushed because of this lack of attention to detail. 

It is fleshed out and believable worlds that are a trademark of Bethesda games, and it is a shame to see it really lacking here.
	Playing a scoundrel and a thief feels very empty because of this, the opportunities to steal from shops is greatly diminished.

Oddly, some areas are not like this. The [The_Well](The_Well.md) has all the expected ‘back rooms’ you would hope to find locked behind a store front. This once again makes me wonder if the game is [rushed](rushed) - some areas appear to have had a lot more time in development than others.

##### ^related to these points:

It's Bethesda's trademark attention to detail with creating exciting 'lived-in' worlds for players to explore at their own leisure, that has made them as popular as they are imo. Whether that be in the Fantasy TES series, of the post apocalyptic Wasteland.

Casual players are apparently willing to overlook lacking quests, rpg systems, or even combat in Skyrim's case, if it means they get to inhabit a foreign and exciting digital world that they can get lost in.

This is what is hurting Starfield for me. The world has too many cracks. Too many instances where it doesn't feel real - where the illusion is broken - and I'm left staring at an amalgamation of OK game systems awkwardly mashed together ([Galls_Law](Galls_Law.md)). 

You used to be able to ride the train??

	How much immersion was axed to try and appease low attention spans?

I decided to work through some of my activities for New Atlantis. While some were interesting to a minor degree, they do often boil down to busy work, traveling between 2-3 loading screens, talking to a few NPCS and then receiving some credits and a little XP. 
	Of course you aren’t expected to do all of these, they’re more just small things to pass the time if you are intrigued. These are much closer to the small style tasks that used to exist in Morrowind and Daggerfall. Easy work that doesn’t need to escalate into a crazy questline. 

They can be boring, especially when they’re ran back to back like this, but that isn’t their purpose. They’re more of a way to integrate yourself into the community and ingratiate yourself with the people. Which makes me wish that this had a reputation mechanic tied to it. 
	It would feel just that little bit sweeter to have a meta-game reward for completing these goals. New Vegas also had similarly basic back and forth style tasks at times (like helping the Garret twins in Freeside, or any of the Freeside quests for that matter), and I found the little “Reputation increased” pop up to greatly improve the sense of accomplishment.
		Better still if there was some acknowledgment in the ending [Unity](Unity.md) slideshow

#### How does New Atlantis exist? 
It’s a city built on a Hydroelectric dam. We have a source of water at the top, a lake. 

And Lakes also need a source of water… which is? 
Maybe it’s underground rivers, but they usually have signs of their existence on the surface, like mountains, which is what they typically run through. 
	Pumped hydro (pumped storage hydropower) does exist and is a well-established technology for energy storage. It involves using two water reservoirs at different elevations to store energy when it's in excess and release it when needed, like a giant battery.

Where does the water at the bottom of the damn go too? Within a few weeks of use, the reservoir at the top will have run dry, and the runoff at the bottom will have overflowed and escaped. Perhaps it’s a self-sustaining loop, where water is piped from the bottom to the top, but where are these pipes? 

They COULD be these obscure ones in [The_Well](The_Well.md), but we never see where they go on the surface. It’s hit and miss. [AnyAustin](Gargarin.md) has an excellent video detailing how well developed the pipelines are in Gagarin, but then you go to the capital of that exact Star System, and it has a magical, endless power source. 

The Transit system also must either have an inter-rail elevator system or go up in a large spiral. Seeing as Sarah mentioned how they feel ill on the train, I have to lean on the latter. This isn’t impossible, and I guess a necessity if the [United_Colonies](United_Colonies.md) deemed it a requirement for such a transport system to exist for a town of a few thousand citizens that stretches barely a mile square. I suppose, as always, we must take the settlement sizes in modern BGS with a grain of salt.
