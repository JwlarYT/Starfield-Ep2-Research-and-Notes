Frontier town, the American’s that defeated the British (or tried to in this case). Ran away due to disagreement with UC government to form their own society based on freedom and not conforming to government mandates. (UC requires all to work for the Gov as military or scientists to get citizenship, it is not a birth right)

Akila, as a city, is far more interesting to me than [New_Atlantis](New_Atlantis.md). The rugged aesthetic helps the town feel more grounded, which I’m sure is by design. [New_Atlantis](New_Atlantis.md) is too clean, too perfect (ignoring [The_Well](The_Well.md)), highlighting how the UC wishes to portray itself, versus the ‘realism’ of the Freestar Collective, adobe and brick houses protected behind walls on the frontier of the fairly dangerous red-dusted desert wilderness surrounding.

0:10 "The [Freestar_Collective](Freestar_Collective.md), a loose collective of three distinct Star Systems"
	Narion barely counts let's be honest. The only "distinct" location is the Clinic, which was the start of the [Narion War](History.md) to be fair.
		Niira probably was distinct, but we dont get a chance to see that as it was flattened and had it's atmosphere destroyed.

0:20 "They believe in the sanctity of personal freedom and individuality"
	Classical Liberalism:
	**Individual rights and freedoms**: Central to its philosophy is the belief that each person has inherent rights (such as freedom of speech, religion, and property).
	**Limited government**: The state exists primarily to protect these individual rights and should interfere as little as possible in people's lives.
	**Rule of law**: Laws apply equally to all individuals and protect freedoms.
	**Free markets**: Economic freedom is often seen as a crucial part of personal liberty.
