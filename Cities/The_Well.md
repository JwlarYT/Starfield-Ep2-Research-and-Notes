[New_Atlantis](New_Atlantis.md) began with the Well, which was constructed from the dismantled colony ship that had landed on Jeminson. Information from the owner of the MedBay in the Well, whose equipment still dates back to that original ship. Explains the Megaton-esque junktown aesthetic of The Well and how the NasaCore art style permeates places like this. Much of the tech used IS still that old NASA tech from back on Earth. The areas that have advanced back that, like [New_Atlantis](New_Atlantis.md) topside, [Akila_City](Akila_City.md), etc, have moved on and created their aesthetic.

Folks in the Well either consider themselves one step above homeless or happier than those top-side, as everyone in [New_Atlantis](New_Atlantis.md) proper is too concerned with appearances and being successful, whereas folks in the Well are more ‘real’.
