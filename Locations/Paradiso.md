Holiday resort. Mexico to the Americans and Spain to the Brits. People who want to escape the hustle and bustle and don’t much care for the locals that have a claim on the land (in this case a colony ship whose claim is outdated - what did they mean by this lol )

[Consequences](Writing/Consequences.md)
How I would solve the issue of not being able to kill the board with the use of consequences:
- Killing the boards gives a hefty bounty of 10k each, and the whole resort becomes hostile. Likely to build up over 100k in bounty.
- Colonists claim the planet immediately, but kick out the player for being a murderer 
- Within 2 in-game days, they have been forced into labour (as per the normal quest) by the remaining board/company located elsewhere that have come to take back over.
- If you still have the bounty - Paradiso will still be hostile.
- If not, they will be rude to you and mention that they too know all too well the power of money. From here, assassins will chase the player every few in-game days.
- Killing the remaining board: the colonists take back the planet but kick you out and vow to shoot on sight
- Within 2 weeks of game time, the location will be overrun by pirates, and the colonist bodies will be stuffed in the basement (reference to Tenpenny Tower)
- This shames the player for being a physco, while still allowing the option.

Talk about how Paradiso's problems emanate into all aspects of the game - the apathy in the writing. Never pushing the options as far as they can be - as they HAVE been before.
