What can be said that hasn’t already. The footage speaks for itself. 
Fundamentally the problem comes from it being designated as a bar - so just like every other bar in the cities of the game, it has job postings and recruitable crewmates, despite it being a nightclub that is so loud it can be heard 30 feet away as you walk towards it. [Voice performances](Sound%20Design.md) make no effort to convey the loudness of the environment, and the dance moves often do not translate to the music. We’ve already established that immersion in this game is frequently impossible, and this is one of the many reasons why.

Astral lounge NPCs are nightmare fuel. Just standing still, looking at their watch and when interacting, they reply without even moving their lips.

Writing and voice acting choices seem to imply that the Astral Lounge was meant to be something closer to a strung-out Opium bar (like Gommorah in NV) than a club originally. 
No one is talking loudly except for radiant NPCs. 

My theory is that Aurora’s effect as a drug was reworked into a party drug at some point. It slows time when taken by the player, which should be more like an opioid than something like XTC or coke. (although slowing time for combat does make sense for an upper, too, so Idk). 

The knock-off trance music choice is meh. They should’ve hired a more competent producer to create some tracks; this music doesn’t feel like it would organically create the reactions of other NPCs, drug or no drug. 
BorealUS certainly isn’t the ‘best DJ ever’ no matter how much the game wants us to believe that. 

[World Building](World%20Building.md) - What happened to our IRL music? Did we lose it ALL at the end of the Earth? People were saving so many Dickens books that they forgot their dogs AND musical instruments/collections? How sad.
