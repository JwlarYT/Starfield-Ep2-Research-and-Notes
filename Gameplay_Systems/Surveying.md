Barret had a funny line that even sounded a little bit sarcastic - *“Exhilarating isn’t it, being the first to scan these things…”*
My thoughts on the game system exactly. Very… *“exhilarating”*. 

[Planet](Presentation/Planets.md) [exploration](Exploring/•Exploring.md) is all about surveying. 

I can’t even argue that this is an optional game system like the outposts mostly are, as we are forever reminded of it. 
+ Want to see where to go? Open the surveyor. 
+ Want to see how far? Surveyor. 
+ Need to find a temple? Surveyor. 
It’s fully integrated. We aren’t forced, but you’re lying to yourself if you think you’re doing anything other than purposefully ignoring the mechanic.

Surveying is a laborious process - why is it necessary to scan 10 of each item? Where did they even get this from? The obvious influence of this gameplay mechanic would be No Man’s Sky, which requires a grand total of 1 scan per item. Why artificially inflate this requirement 10-fold? 
+ For their arbitrary [skill system](Progression.md) of course, why else? Maxing out Zoology and Biology, both tier 2 Science skills, will lower this number to a reasonable amount. We are required, however, to dedicate 12 level-up skill points to this endeavour. Points that could be better spent on a whole host of other perks.

Surveying as a system only exists as a sci-fi interpretation of a biologist’s job in identifying a previously undiscovered species of [fauna or flora](Presentation/Planets.md). Interpretation being the key word. 
It may take a trained eye hours or even days to identify a new discovery accurately, but for the sake of your playerbase, consider shortening it to less than 10 scans. 

Surveying fish in the ocean is an infuriatingly slow process.  
Taking 25 minutes running up and down a coastline to scan a fish isn’t exactly peak gameplay, especially when we cannot dive underwater. 
**Why can’t we go underwater?**
Because a biome for it does not exist, as seen here with a broken element of the surface algorithm, where a 'wetlands' biome has been truncated by a mountainous one. Which is strange because the assets for a biome do exist ([New_Atlantis](Cities/New_Atlantis.md)). I consider this to be possible cut content.

From a game design point, I think the rewards for surveying and [•Exploring](Exploring/•Exploring.md) the planets (the ones with life) have been well balanced. I received enough XP to level up twice, and the survey data netted me a nice sum when sold to Vlad. So while it did at the time feel a little bit like a waste of time, looking back, it was worth it.

Now I will say, surveying fulfils a purpose: Relaxing gameplay. 
Or as a pessimist may call it, Podcast gaming. 
There were times, after a long play session recording gameplay of a [faction](Factions/•Factions.md) questline, where I enjoyed sitting back, switching over to the controller and turning my brain off as I mindlessly chased the pretty blue glowy objects. Ignoring the fact that the average player likely isn’t playing Starfield while note-taking to the point where such a choice had to be made; this is essentially a mini-game like 'Powerwash Simulator' plonked into an open-world RPG. 
Seeing that it is entirely optional outside of specific, and admittedly, rare quests, its inclusion isn’t entirely egregious. 

It’s that juxtaposition that confuses me, why is it in a RPG? Not the system itself, but the way it’s designed. [Constellation](../Main_Quest/Constellation.md) is an explorer group, and Starfield’s interpretation of that isn’t so much Christopher Coloumbus as it is Charles Darwin. Of course, we should be spending some time finding “what’s out there” (Sarah's quote), and documenting for the masses that follow. 
But 10 scans per object? Mods that lower this down to 5 do not - in any way - harm the [Role-Playing](Role-Playing.md) aspect of surveying. I’m not suddenly thinking “damn this isn’t exploring at all, I’m only surveying this brand new flower a five times, how is that believable”. 

We have an advanced watch with tech capable of highlighting these objects in the first place, I’m fully capable of extending my suspension of disbelief that tiny bit further.

I can’t imagine anyone at [Quality_Assurance](Development/Quality_Assurance.md) took 30+ plus minutes to fully complete a planet and thought “that that was a reasonable use of time” compared with the faster paced questlines, combat, the damn striped back outpost building is more  nimble than this. 
If I were being generous, starting at 10 scans isn’t necessarily terrible, but locking the means of universally lowering it behind [12 skill points](Progression.md) is. In my opinion, the surveying skill in Tier 1 should’ve unlocked lower required surveys at Tier 2, lowering it 1 or 2 scans by Tier 4, and then have a skill on the second layer that increases the surveying distance, which is what the Surveying skill currently does.

Birds on Jeminson, outside [New_Atlantis](Cities/New_Atlantis.md) - Their AI has not progressed since Cliff Racers - hilarious.

Sea creatures are fully designed and rendered, which can be killed and swam up to loot, really screams of cut content. The fact that we cannot dive to see these fish before murdering them is a missed opportunity.

Absolutely missing a visual catalog per planet like NMS. Would have been perfect for players like me that love to visit every planet to discover the animals had flora.

#### How it fits into [Role-Playing](Role-Playing.md)
I presume the decision was to reflect our inexperience with the [Constellation](../Main_Quest/Constellation.md) job. We are an ex-rock miner, sensibly we may not be the best educated to distinguish an undocumented specimen accurately. 

What about the biologist background then? I designed *this* character (Jett) specifically to interact with this part of the game, allowing myself to role-play a Constellation explorer as they have been written. Yet playing this way becomes a chore where I’d rather ignore the actual skills I chose. Only further highlighting how little importance the character creation has.

[Quality_Assurance](Development/Quality_Assurance.md) issue: It is frustrating to collect resources that cannot be mined using the lazer. You cannot harvest them with the scanner up, so you must use the scanner to find them, then put it away to harvest, then bring it back to continue scanning. QOL would say to let you harvest while in the scanner - it already lets you loot containers and pick up clutter while up, so why not this?
	This was fixed in an update, you can now collect resources and loot containers with the scanner open - [Bug_Fixes&Other_Changes](../New_Updates/Bug_Fixes&Other_Changes.md)

You can accidentally sell your cutter! I will have to find/purchase another one. 
	This doesn't matter much however as mining using the cutter is horribly inefficient, and you're better off using outposts of simply buying ther material if you wish to interact with [Crafting](Crafting.md)
		The main purpose of keeping it is to cut "secret doors" in [Points_of_Interest](Exploring/Points_of_Interest.md)
