You can hire crew members in some taverns. These are randomly generated, and bring with them a skill that can help improve your ship. They cannot be used as companions - only allocated to your spaceship or one of your outposts. They are expensive, but can be made cheaper through a speech check.

Companions not looking at the NPCs they’re talking to is unnerving. Sarah was making a joke about Sam to Cora (his daughter) while staring deep into my eyes. It feels off, especially when the camera moves back to the other NPC and they’re looking off to the side as they should to indicate they are talking to someone next to you. This may be a bug seeing as the functionality is clearly there, it just isn’t triggering when an NPC is your companion.
	No better with the new face cam option choice, but less obvious now

So far all of the ones you can romance appear to be bi, which is nice for those who want to romance everyone, but I think for realisms sake it would’ve been better to again follow NV and have some that were bi, straight and gay. So some characters didn’t have a chance. (Even though you couldn’t romance them in NV, I just mean from the perspective of not all of them just existing to bend to the player whim and goals).

“Minor” companions are still fairly developed, like Lin and Heller. Both are written to encourage players to check out [New_Homestead](../Cities/New_Homestead.md) on Titan. 
+ (Need to check if the families they mention are there, and if they react to them as companions)

Companions gather resources and clog Activities list.

The [Constellation](../Main_Quest/Constellation.md) companions have by far the most substantial bonuses, so being able to stack all of them onto your ship will generally make you very powerful (as long as you’re upgrading/levelling your ship as you play). 

Based on how crew members will praise the player for docking in the same way they praise us for [Lockpicking](Lockpicking.md), there may have been an intended minigame for docking at one point.

Affinity works as a percentage, increasing or decreasing by a few points based on dialogue and gameplay choices. This percentage can be manipulated with a perk to speed up the rate of increase.

Improvements to companion system:
- No separate companion inventory. Instead companions just give a default +100 (or similar) to your carry capacity. Offset this with similar effects for the loner perk which is already in game. Equip companion items by marking them in your inventory. Companions hold onto their equipped slot gear when they leave the party. 
- Companions gifting dialogue only happens once. Instead of getting the dialogue every five minutes about "I have something for you" and it's Sarah with a random single leaf. You just get that dialogue the first time and then later on they add it to your inventory automatically.
- Companions stop giving you things when they're mad. Right now I have the worst of all worlds where Sarah keeps telling me "I have something for you" but I talk to her and she doesn't have the option for me to claim it because she's mad at me.

All 4 major companions share the same moral compass and essentially the same attitude towards every major choice in the game. Minor companions bring little to the table in comparison.

#### Sam & Cora

Cora, in general, is the biggest crime of laziness in the entire game. She's just an accessory for Sam's "brooding single dad you feel bad for" character rather than being an actual person herself.

And before an update nearly a year after launch, you couldn't even give her books, the one personality trait she had. I was also an avid reader as a kid and was excited to track down books for her.

##### Romance

Done poorly because every character is magically bi. Completely immersion breaking. It's just there to satisfy player agency agaisnt realistic world building.
