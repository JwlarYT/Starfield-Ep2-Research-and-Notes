Space flying is fine, but it may feel better with a controller. I missed the tutorial; perhaps this was because I was streaming, or it could have been because the text tutorial was playing as I was engaging in combat, making it hard to focus on both.

Follows the common trope in both films and games: space is just air, and spaceships are just airships.
	This should be space. How can there be a maximum velocity? And why aren't thrusters used to slow us down?

Control glitch - you cannot loot spaceship debris if you use F as your “use” key. Had to remap to the default for the loot menu to work. (Need to verify if this persists, or was a one-off thing)

Spaceship systems are as expected from a light “space sim”. Concession to controllers means you cannot individually hotkey each system, as in other games, i.e., where you can independently increase and decrease power to the shields and lasers. In Starfield, you must switch between each system one at a time to change the allocation of power.

Space [Stealth](Stealth.md) is achieved by deactivating all primary systems, such as shields and weapons, making this a precarious manoeuvre. This will be handy when facing enemy spacecraft that vastly outlevel the player, or are in such large numbers that a dogfight would be too dangerous.
	This is primarily a useless feature that is only used to quickly grav jump/fast travel away if the player finds themselves faced with odds against their favour. It is never used to bypass ships as used in the Venus tutorial.

Space ‘[•Exploring](Exploring/•Exploring.md)’ is clunky and a menu-based facsimile of other space games that do it better. Still, though, I found myself more drawn to this flawed system more than general questing. 
	This speaks more to the weakness of said questlines than it does to the strength of space travel/[•Exploring](Exploring/•Exploring.md).
It fits the wider [Role-Playing](Role-Playing.md) elements better, taking missions from boards and interacting with the space-sim side of the game. Even if it is the weakest space sim I have played. 

You can mine asteroids by blowing them up and looting them like destroyed ships.

Ships all handle the same with a small difference in top speed not having any noticeable effect.

There's no joy in flying my ship around because there is no where to fly it too. There's no meaningful flying. I can [create](Ship_Building.md) a cool ship, but why bother when all ships fundamentally have identical handling? Just put enough engines and thrusters on to get the correct rating every time. There's no concept of a fast nimble small fighter vs a huge lumbering freighter with turrets. I would happily trade in ship customisation for preset ships if it meant the ships felt different to fly (and there was meaningful flying to take advantage of that).

According to a developer on Starship Simulator, it is extremely difficult to have both explorable spaceship interiors and real-time planetary landings. An interior with thousands of props with physics means that the interior environment must be static, and the space is moved around the ship. Which means the planets themselves are moving and cannot have complex surfaces. The tradeoff of having both is to have a transition between the two isolated, static environments. Like Starfield's landing cut scene. That's why NMS doesn't have ship interiors.

#### Combat
Space combat isn’t too brutal when fighting on level enemies, even on an enhanced difficulty setting. Seems to be balanced around the Vanilla Frontier, funnily enough, because that's the only time it stays moderately challenging. As soon as you start upgrading your ship, it becomes trivial unless you deliberately face overpowered enemies. Fortunately, there is no level scaling, so we can do just that.

Standing up during space combat prevented enemy ships from attacking. Breaks [Immersion](Presentation/Immersion.md).
#### Space Encounters
[Random space encounters](Exploring/Random_Encounters.md) sometimes find the player stumbling across a space battle between pirates or spacers versus the [United_Colonies](Factions/United_Colonies.md)/[Freestar_Collective](Factions/Freestar_Collective.md). 
When working correctly, we can assist the colonial powers in combating these bandits and earn credits, ship repair parts, or a share of the plunder as a reward. Often, however, probably due to a stray laser or missile, the friendlies will turn hostile, forcing us to escape using the grav drive. This issue occurred in previous games, but the ability to yield resolved it. 
We cannot yield in space combat, forcing us to run away and pay the bounty off at a bounty clearance board found in the three main cities.
