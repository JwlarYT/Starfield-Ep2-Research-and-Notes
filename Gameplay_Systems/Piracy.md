Ship selling - I had to register it first, which cost around 80% of its value. As a result, when I did sell it, I received only a $2,000 profit from an $8,000 value item. Not a great trade-off, and makes piracy less appealing, in my opinion.

Piracy is hit and miss, some random encounters won't let you pilot the ship, saying you’re not authorised. That’s the point of piracy; following authorisation kind of goes against the whole stealing thing.

Stealing a ship requires the ability to repair it and it will only become a part of your fleet once you have fast-travelled using it. Probably for balance, but I wish we could just assign a crew member to it to act as its captain. Like in Sea Dogs 2 / POTC, which Emil worked on personally as a translator/writer.
