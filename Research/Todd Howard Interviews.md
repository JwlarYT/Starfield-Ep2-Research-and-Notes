##### [Notch & Todd Howard - The One-on-One Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvAzPQBrKOc&list=PLM_F6ru-Us2x81nVrr7NIWlvvpf5X4KwJ&index=90)

Todd talks about bringing mods to the console in 2011 after the Skyrim release

Todd is aware of the disconnect between their questing and sandbox gameplay. [• Gameplay Systems](•%20Gameplay%20Systems.md)
2:05 "What we try to do is... give the player tools and then let them run wild, whenever we try to get control back, either we do it the wrong way, or it doesn't have the right impact that the other things do when we can just 'here's a bunch of tools, have fun'."

The advent of the [Creation Club integration](Creation%20Club%20integration.md)
2:45 "On the whole PC side, releasing our tools, we would love to get that on the consoles somehow. Our users are making these awesome mods, they're so good at it, they're so creative. And on the PC, I think that's what defines the PC version of our game. In many ways, that makes it the superior version, because it becomes like this role-playing system, and people just like to look at each other's stuff they've built, much like Minecraft."

[World Building](World%20Building.md)
9:35 "For us y'know, the world is the main character of the game."

[Story](Story.md) 
9:45 "Two types of people. They want to be told what to do, finish the main quest, see the credits roll and move on to the next game. But the majority of our audience is more... it's their game, they want to make the character and just do whatever. It's why we put so much content in it, so that they feel like they have a lot to do. That's the common thing, that they avoided the main quest for this long, and I should see what it's about."

How internal research works
13:08 ''We do these like, every other week we show a game at lunch to the team, whoever wants to come, and everyone will watch it and then we'll talk about it"
"It's interesting, like when you play a game and how you feel about it, and then you sit down with a group of people and they hear what they have to say."

15 June 2016, GameSpot

6:25 Reacting to feedback - why critiques are important and isn't just blind hating.
"We do like to try new things, and we'll have some successes. I think the shooting in Fallout 4 is really good, obviously the way we did some dialogue stuff, that didn't work as well."
"So, for us we take that feedback, and I think long-term."
"I don't just think 'oh it's this point in time, and I think that kind of feedback we get is really, really helpful."
"Everybody does have an opinion, and I think that's good, ya know."

10:00 When asked about their demographics:
"I don't think about it a lot, actually. We've been fortunate enough where our audience has gotten big enough. Generally, our audience is more hardcore gamers, but there's a lot of them, I feel,' oh that hits more of a casual audience'."
"We make the game for ourselves, like 'what do we like to play?', it generally finds an audience. So, maybe they're like us? Yeah, I don't know, I haven't given it a lot of thought."
	Lack of market research - resulting in a game made for themselves lack-of-free-time dads more interested in the tech than role-playing options

14:44 What was on Todd's radar in 2016 (during pre-production of Starfield)
 - VR Stuff
 - Battlefield One
 - He doesn't get hands-on with the games and prefers to watch someone else play

4 June 2019, IGN

1:02:18 Todd’s first new IP EVER. He has only followed what came before until now. He had some general idea of what to do - look at his speech about how Arena is nigh-on identical to Skyrim in premise. He didn’t have a premise to follow!

##### [Constellation Questions: Talking Starfield with Todd Howard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDNimT0O8LE)
13 Oct 2022, Bethesda

0:43 Starfield inspirations: 
- [Sundog](Sundog) - sci-fi game with 'partialist interface' (moving objects around and putting them together) where you could fly around on your own ship.
- [Traveller TTRPG ](Traveller%20TTRPG%20)- Hard sci-fi. Todd tried to program a CRPG version on the Apple II. Where he discovered that computers could run out of memory. 
- 1:35 "Can we pull off something like this with today's computers?"

1:50 Is Starfield considered [Hard Sci Fi](Hard%20Sci%20Fi.md)?
- Yes, more so hard sci fi to BGS team.
- Visual identity harkens back to that.
- It's still a video game, so full realism isn't too important.
- They implemented a fuel system, and soon discovered it to be punitive and stop gameplay. 
- "Recently" changed this in Oct 2022, less than a year from release. Huge gameplay change so close to shipping.
- Acknowledges that a [Mod](Reliance%20on%20Mods.md) may change that.

2:58 Character Customisation
- Wanted to remove replay value as player shouldn't feel like they "don't like their character and should start over" as they can remove their trait in-game

3:20 [Dialogue](Dialogue.md)
- Scope is "a bit more than we've done before in quests and things like that"
- 250,000 dialogue lines, which Todd claims "has impact".
- 3:59 Persuasion system: "Feels like it's part of the dialogue"

##### [Todd Howard: Skyrim, Elder Scrolls 6, Fallout, and Starfield | Lex Fridman Podcast #342](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9AAnV59ddE)
Lex Fridman, 29 Nov 2022

29:00 Need for [Outsourcing](outsourcing.md)
"There's a ton of work that goes into it now. Just rendering this cup to the perfect shine, material and roughness, and how the Global illumination reacts to it, it's a ton of work."
30:45 "The amount of art time that it takes to create a cup compared to what it used to has increased. So we do use Art outsourcing."

32:13 [Immersion](Immersion.md): 
"How does the wind sound? I enjoy strolling and watching the sunset. How does it land over the water? It doesn't have to be 'ok, let's go, let's finish the next quest, let's go level up'." "That's just part of being that character, being that person, in that space."

35:21 Uniqueness: 
"Find that, what's gonna make something kind of unique, and usually I lean on something that is grounded in reality for what it is. And then have lesser, kind of, fantastical things at the start."
"We have laser guns and space ships and blah blah blah, but you can look at it and say 'ok, this is kind of an extension of things as we view them today in space'."

44:50 What's involved in programming when creating an open-world game? What are the challenges?
"We want to build systems"
"You can't go through and do everything by hand per se"
"So you have to rely on some systemic level of creation and a lot of systems that are robust enough so that when they touch another one, they aren't breaking apart." 
"A lot of people confuse engines with rendering"
"Most of the engine is how do we bring in this data and give it to the renderer to draw it?"

48:55 On NPC Ai improving:
"We're always iterating on it, and again, as we look on the future, it's more about us finding more reactivity to the player and understanding their role in the world. They aren't just there as a signpost to the player."

51:30 [Voice Acting](Dialogue.md):
"We used to do (voice recording) at the end of a project, but now we do it throughout. We start early, we're recording for years and years."

52:30 Todd acknowledges that [Romance](Romance) isn't complex
"It's one of the things we pushed in Starfield. We have 4 of them, I wouldn't say super complex romance, but more complex than we've had. In terms of not just some state of they just like you or don't like you, but they love you and be pissed off with you, and then come back to loving you."
53:50 Very rare from Todd. 
"A little bit more complex. I don't want to oversell that part."

57:08 What is the origin story of Starfield?
"We had always wanted to do something where you explore space"
Mentions [Traveller TTRPG](Traveller%20TTRPG.md) again
"[Starfilght](Starfilght), [Star Control 2](Star%20Control%202)"
"It was time to do something new" minor burnout over TES and FO
"You mentioned Daggerfall, we go back to some of that"

They did play around with the idea of a smaller set of limited handcrafted zones.
"How are we gonna render a planet, can we? Or are we gonna do it where we're landed in very controlled, small world space where we kinda craft and we have a very limited set of that." "That's probably the wrong tone."

59:10 "I wanna land on that ice ball"
“We started the game right after Fallout 4, in 2016. The first thing we did was think about how we could generate these planets and make them look, I'll say, reasonable, as opposed to fractal-y goop.”

59:50 [Procedurally generated](Procedural%20Generation.md) tiles and went in to fix any errors, then built a system that took those and wrapped them around a planet and blended them. 
	How many man-hours were wasted on this? They were already using proc-gen for the basis of Oblivion and Skyrim's land masses, so it's likely a very updated version of that tech. But rather than generating a single tile, they would've had to kick out tens of millions.
		Although admittedly, Todd does reiterate that after the system was built, the choice to make 1000 planets took little effort.:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1kxwhho/ads_must_be_trolling_right/
^Can see how the tiles have been wrapped as pixels on this corrupted planet.

1:03:35 "Once you're building a system that can build a planet, once you have a system that can build that much space, you just change the number and press the button".

59:50 "We came up with a way of building tiles. Like large tiles of landscape... and end up with these very realistic looking tiles of landscapes, and then built a system that wraps those around a planet and blends them all together."

1:00:00 The obsession with technicality from Todd: "And we had pretty successful results with that. So we thought, 'yeah, we could do this'." Too concerned with whether they could, not on whether they should.
	This then led to the game design behind exploration. The technical marvel of wrapping convincing proc-gen tiles around a planet, and not a focus on gameplay. Surveying wasn't added because it was a system they wanted; it was added to fill in the void.

1:00:25 "There was a big design problem to solve with what's fun with landing on a planet with potentially nothing. There's nothing on them except resources. Ok, let's lean on the lonely experience, these are the resources that are there, go find them".
	If that was the gameplay loop they focussed on, why are the gameplay systems that use these resources, [Crafting](Crafting.md) and [Outpost Management](Outpost%20Management.md) so gimped compared to FO4. And relegated to side activities with barely any function to any questlines.

[Travelling](Travelling.md) 1:04:56 "We used to run out of fuel, you'd jump and get stranded."
"Turn out that just stops your game, ok, I guess I'll just wander these planets and mine for fuel to get back to what I was doing - it's a fun killer."

[Minority Report](Minority%20Report) - "There's a lot of future stuff in that movie"

[Progression](Progression.md)  - 1:44:26 "One of the things that over times we've wanted to avoid is people starting over"
"There's a lot of intentionality around the type of choices you have can be undone or not undone."
"So that you don't make this character in the beginning and then 8 hours later realise you made a terrible experience. That to me is a really, really bad experience."
1:46:05 "Some starting skills that get you off to the type of play that you want, but if you discover you don't like that kind of play, you can move that character along."

1:47:36 Why is it bad to break the game? [Side Quests](Side%20Quests.md)
"Well, people love in Morrowind where you could teleport to different areas - they break so many quests"
"We would do this exercise of designing a quest and then someone would say, 'and then I recall away', 'oh okay, the quest is broken."
"And then one day someone says, 'Can we just get rid of that spell effect?' Everyone was like 'yes, please'. And so it allows us to make better content."

[Side Quests](Side%20Quests.md) / [Radiant Quests](Radiant%20Quests.md) - 1:48:50 Todd understands good open ended quest design that relies on the player to answer the quest themselves, but yet we see so little of this in-game outside of the radiant missions...
'The best ones for me are actually were all of that was far more open-ended. The how I am going to accomplish this task is completely up to me, and I'm gonna find some ingenious solution.
"It's like, go find me five daedra hearts or whatever, like find me X of something that's hard to get. You can give a simple story set up for that.
And we're not telling the player where to get those. And they think, now, where could I get those? If those objects are in the world
in some believable way, that there's usually some challenge at getting them."
	Funnily enough, I've seen people take this out of context and say this is the reason behind terrible quest design, focusing too hard on the fetch quest element, and not enough on the freedom of gameplay side. The majority of Morrowind is *this* quest design, but it works due to the writing and gameplay systems involved. The same quest design in Skyrim falls apart because the narrative is straightforward, and the quest follows a quest marker rather than answering the question ourselves.

1:50:45 [Level Design](Level%20Design.md)
"There is a logic to making a good level. Even if you walk by a little T intersection, that becomes like a decision point in the player's head.
'Like, oh, I didn't go down that way.'" 
"But the more you do that, it looks easy on paper, but when you're playing a game, you actually wanna limit those because he's trying to keep track of all these decision points. Then they get lost." 
"And yes, we have maps, but anytime the player's going to check a map in a place like that, I feel that it's more of like a backstop for certain players. If they need to check the map, I feel like we've kind of failed."
"You don't wanna ever be maze-y, as long as you know where you're going, as long as you know you made those choices, then it feels fine."

1:54:30 They lean into the Reddit post 'I have 70,000 hours in Skyrim and I never knew this' type thing:
"We would have a thing we call 'Did you Know Moments'" "Like, we gotta have a bunch, so we meet someone, and then they say 'did you know' if you go here and do this. 'What?!'"
"That to us is where a lot of our community has been sharing their stories"

2:01:11 How did you know the delay was the right thing to do?
"You can look at what needs to be done and the time you have, and we reached a point on Starfield where it was pretty clear to us, even though you want to say that you can get it done, that the risk involved with that to the fans, to the game, to the team, to the company, we're part of Xbox now, to everybody was 'we should really move it and give it the time it needs'".

Lots of [• Gameplay Systems](•%20Gameplay%20Systems.md) not working together
2:19:13 "These are the elements you have to play with, how do we make this all work together and you come out of it at the end of the day like 'now that feels great" *gulps and and blinks multiple times*

2:19:40
"You feel like you've made tangible progress on the actual build of the game"
"Where something you played at the beginning of the day, didn't feel great, you figured out a solution with a group of people - it's always with a group. And by the next day, then you're like 'yep, that worked out'."

##### [Starfield Interview: Todd Howard on Fulfilling His Vision, Xbox Performance, and More!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gs22Sn2VMU)
22 Jun 2023, IGN

2:05 "We view our job as 'hey, just do the best job we can do, put everything we can into the game."

2:50 How was the delay spent at BGS?
"Honing systems and interface, bug fixing, all those things."
	Usually by the the months leading up to release, everything should be mostly honed, and time is spent on QA and optimisation. Worrying that they were still perfecting the game at this time.

7:05 How did the game evolve over the course of 8 years [• Development](•%20Development.md)
"The game sticks to the original vision... that took longer than I wanted, but about halfway through the project you realise this is why nobody tries to make this game."
"It is true for the vision we had for our type of role-playing game set in space, where your mind kind of goes. We want to, as much as possible, say yes to the player. Can I do this? Can I do this? The answer is yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."
7:55 "Space is big, so the amount of content that we ended making to have that really feel authentic to that, that did grow from where we originally started."

9:05 Inspirations
"More of feeling like Read Dead 2, I'm living this western fantasy. In this I'm living this Science Fiction explorer fantasy."
	I want to Todd! But you already discovered everything for me!
10:19 [Smoke and mirrors](Smoke%20and%20mirrors.md)
"It's games where I feel I am rooted in the reality of this universe of the game, and everything else just disappear." 

11:50 "The more you give to Starfield, the more it gives back, and that was one of our goals"
	Sort of true in that ship building, outpost building and crafting require large time, [Progression](Progression.md) and credit investments to get the most out of them - but the journey to get there will burn out many players with the ARPG adjacent [• Exploring](•%20Exploring.md) and [Points of Interest](Points%20of%20Interest.md) system.

12:30 How much of the 1000 planets will the main story lead you towards. How do you motivate the players to see what's out there?
"We want to keep it sort of manageable in the main quest. But it's a small fraction of what's in the game."

13:32 Skyrim's success motivated the inclusion of [NG+](NG+.md) and the use of [Procedural Generation](Procedural%20Generation.md) to create a universe that could be played 'forever'
"We've also learned, look we're sitting here 12 years after Skyrim, we're looking at a game that has over 60 million copies and all these people, they're still playing it"
"We have learned that we need to build in from the beginning a game that has this long-term play thought of so. Hopefully people are playing a long time from now."

14:11 What was concept of post release plan at this date?
"I mean look, we're going to be doing a lot of addon content for Starfield."
"Our plan is do things of varying sizes. We've done a lot of that in our previous games so it's something that we really doing."

14:40 "Despite the size of the game, there's still things we want to add as far as features and stories and things like that"
	Wanted to add more features even at this point, possibly vehicles?

15:15 Todd's favourite moment while playing
- Walking through sandstorm to near by landed ship, ambushed by crew, goes on board, ship takes off and now he's in space
		Todd was in awe of the tech, shocked that can even happen. He cares more about [systems](•%20Gameplay%20Systems.md) than quests, all of the people at the end of the direct do. 

17:20 Is Starfield a failure in Todd's eyes?
"I think for us it is that, you know, people say they love the game. I think all games go through a couple of phases. What do they think of it the first week it comes out. But then you've got to think about what do they think after a year? What doe they think after year two?"
"I hope that it sort of stands the test of time."

18:30 Progression was designed to take hundreds of hours to complete
"There are systems you can design that say 'hey look this system is going to work over a long-term play, hundreds of hours, like a character system. Versus: 'Yeah after 30 you've burnt through everything. That's certainly not the case here."

25:16 Todd knows the USP as a everything game. [• Gameplay Systems](•%20Gameplay%20Systems.md)
"You could say in some respects this is like five or six games in one. It's the spaceship game, it's a on the ground game, it's just a dialogue game, it's an outpost game, it's a crafty game"
"It does all of these things, and it's always is tricky for us to get a good game flow where those things don't feel like they're seperate games. That they can weave in and out of them in a way that holistically creates something greater than the sum of it's parts."
	They failed

27:00 [Procedural Generation](Procedural%20Generation.md)
"Why do you have a thousand planets? Because we'd rather give you that option than say no."

27:16 "If you like science fiction, I hope Starfield builds that kind of desire to play that kind of thing in Starfield"
	Evan loves science fiction, and Starfield disappointed him

22 Jun 2023, Kinda Funny Games

9:08 - "That kind of feeling is what we want. Where you can look at the scope of the game and the palette of things you can do, and say what if? I'm gonna do these things."
	This is what Starfield suffers from. Possibly due to the lack of a starting point. People may start that palette by aiming in a random direction and starting to walk to see what they find. The [Travelling](Travelling.md) system puts an immediate barrier to entry, especially once the player feels confident in what they will find - [Procedural Generation](Procedural%20Generation.md) and random [Points of Interest](Points%20of%20Interest.md).

16:13 Handcrafted vs Procedural
"The million-dollar question, one that we struggled with early on in the process. We wanted to give you the planets to give you that choice, you would want that choice in a game like this."
"Technically, could we pull it off? And we did... technically, be able to draw these planets and make them feel believable on the screen."

18:20 Lots of emphasis on he resources: "You look at a planet, you see the resources and look at what you want."

18:30 "I love the Buzz Aldrin quote "The Magnificent Desolation" I think there's a certain beauty to landing on those and feeling that I'm one of the only people, OR the only person, to ever visit this planet."

Identified problem with spawning of [Points of Interest](Points%20of%20Interest.md), but incorrectly states that they've dialled it in well.
18:45 "It's a difficult design thing, if it's generating too many abandoned bases or towers or things to find, it starts to feel too gamey." "I think we've dialled that in pretty well."
"It is an exploration different than we've had. Where you're landing, exploring around that landing spot, and then probably going somewhere else."

[Ailments](Ailments.md)
21:20 "We do look at temperature, we look at the radiation, so that you're suit and your protection... You can get certain ailments if you're not ready, and certain weather things can come through with all of that."

[Surveying](Surveying.md)
22:19 "It's a little more zen-like"
21:50 "There's a whole part of the game where surveying a planet, like discovering all of the fauna and flora. Plants also have traits, geological things inherent to that planet, and if you're uncovering those. If you fully survey a planet, that data is worth a lot of credits in the game that you can sell. So it's a whole part of the game just really doing that."

[Terromorph](Terromorph.md)
Todd gets flustered when he realises that the interviewer has already guessed that there will be only one big bad alien.
23:08 "Is there gonna be a special creature in this, or there going to be so many that there won't just be one that we point to and go 'oh wow that was the bad one'"
*Stammers* "There's one really bad one... you'll have to play it."

No [Ground vehicles](Ground%20vehicles.md)
23:50 "We want to design Starfield so it feels good on foot. But we do have the boost pack"
"The boost pack almost acts like this vehicle, it's super fun, where you can fly through… and then the low gravity planets are just really really special in the game."

25:40 - "You can assign [Companions](Companions.md) to ships you're not using and things like that"
Possibly cut content, or just a flubbed line. You cannot do this in the final game.

[Sound Design](Sound%20Design.md)
28:00 "Music is one of the first things we start with. We concept art and we start writing the music"
"The music is all giving us a feeling of what this world feels like, what this experience feels like"

29:40 Is there a space radio?
"There is one, but it is pretty much local to a certain location; it's not something you can dial into."
Todd's probably talking about the SSNN kiosk broadcasts, a bit disingenuous to call this a radio, but it serves a similar purpose to Three Dog, albeit far less omnipresent.

31:35 [Piracy](Piracy.md)
"We make you register it. You have to spend credits to go register it, and that's for us to keep it from the economy, kinda spiralling in those ways."
32:00 [Ship Building](Ship%20building.md) is for the late game; it costs a lot of credits and is deliberately a complicated system. You can easily upgrade the ship, but the choice to alter the ship more deeply was designed as a long-term endgame goal. (Which is how the fans interact with it as well.)

34:40 #GravDrives
"Graviton loop field array. The way the different bands bend space in front of you. You're actually taking space and folding and bringing it towards you."

35:55 What's good about #CreationEngine 2 on a tech level?
"We are so happy with the new engine, it took us so long to do, the techs are wizards - led by Chris Rodrigues and Joel Denolt. What we're able to do in game, and have all these things looking amazing... our lighting model is just awesome, the real-time GI... we have some great volumetric fog and how that interacts with the lighting."

36:40 Lying about [Side Quests](Side%20Quests.md)!
"There are a lot of open-world games now, but what makes ours different is that all these quests are running. It's not like you start a mission and shut everything down."

38:30 [Advanced Combat](Advanced%20Combat.md) 
"This is the best feeling game that we've had"

39:30 Gameiness of [Side Quests](Side%20Quests.md)
"It comes down to making all that content. There really is a lot of it, a lot of specific quests."
[Radiant Quests](Radiant%20Quests.md) "We have a bunch of that. You can land on a planet, go to an outpost, and we're gonna generate a mission nearby, but I think that's okay if you know that you're in for it. And those activities, if the gameplay is good, can be fun, but they shouldn't take the place of those more in-depth ones - and we've done a lot of those."

41:30 [Reliance on Mods](Reliance%20on%20Mods.md) 
"Starfield is gonna be a modder's paradise."
"I think one of the things is that it's important to us to not just enable that, but to participate, to make it not just a hobby, but a career."

42:40 [Outpost Management](Outpost%20Management.md)
"Outposts, like ship building, is a deep system that requires a lot of resources. To really go crazy, you're going to have to develop your character skills and collect those resources."
"It's a really cool system, like shipbuilding, it's one that has a lot of depth, it isn't an early player system."

44:40 Are you confident in Starfield
"We've worked so hard on it, many of us have done this for decades together in some cases and we have put just everything that we think we've learned. Maximum effort into this one. We love it, and our fingers are crossed that everyone feels the way we feel about it."

45:10 Trying for broad appeal
"We're really humbled by everyone's excitement by it, and it's fuel for us to make it as good as it can be for everybody."

46:00 Are you carrying the weight of Xbox on your shoulders?
"We're focusing on what we can do. Xbox's support has been incredible on this, and we have worked with them for a long time. Over 20 years going back to Morrowind"

47:30 Have you ever wanted to do a smaller project?
"We have the mobile team. Fallout Shelter is our most played game at this point."
