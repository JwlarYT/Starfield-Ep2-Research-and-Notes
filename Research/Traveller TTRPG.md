According to Todd there are no faster-than-light communications in Starfield. Communications between star systems are restricted to messages sent on ships. This limitation is taken from the Traveller RPG, which he has mentioned as one of the inspirations for Starfield. So on the galactic scale, communications in Starfield are a lot more like the age of sail than they are our 21st century.

Traveller is a tabletop game where characters journey through star systems, engaging in exploration, ground and space battles, and interstellar trading. The game is influenced by various literary works and emphasises commerce, sociological stratification, and a mix of low and high technology.
The game's history also features the Ancients, a highly advanced race that left behind [ruins](Temples.md) and [Artifacts](artifacts.md) scattered throughout the universe.

Limited communication: There is no Faster-than-light communication â€“ meaning no ansible, subspace radio, or similar. Communication is limited to the speed of travel. Decisions are made on the local level rather than by a remote authority.
###### Low-technology
Since primitive worlds exist near technological worlds, primitive weapons such as swords, shields, pikes, and bows are included. Characters often have some sort of blade skill for close combat.
###### High-technology
Cybernetics and non-sentient robots also show up in equipment lists, as do artifacts from ancient civilizations.
###### Hard Sci-fi Flavor
Along with energy weapons, there is also a strong presence of slug-throwing weapons such as rifles and pistols. The prevailing theory is that (usually) the most efficient way to stop someone is with kinetic energy (e.g. bullets).

Some characters have extra-sensory perception, telekinesis, telepathy, and other psychic abilities, which are organized and standardized into "psionics". [Starborn](Starborn.md)

Fuel system is in Traveller.

Starships range from small one-person scouts, to giant planetoid colony ships.

Worlds range from barren planetoid moons to large gas giant worlds, from uncolonized territories to planets with billions of people.

The ship types remind me of Traveller style ships (industrial, gritty and plausible) and the "background" you pick at character creation has a small Traveller feel.

The "Backgrounds" are loosely Traveller Careers but they only give you 3 skills at 0 level in your "skill package"
Honestly, I don't think that would solve much. The skills in Starfield aren't even really skills, they are gates for core mechanics. It's a skill point tax. And when it's not a new mechanic that should be a default feature, it's lazy stuff like "+10% Ballistic Damage". [Progression](Progression.md)
