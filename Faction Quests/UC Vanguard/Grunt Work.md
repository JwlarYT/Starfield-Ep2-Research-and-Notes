The first quest for the [United Colonies](United%20Colonies.md) has the player traveling to an Earth-like [Planets](Planets.md) to the far west of the [Star System Map](Star%20System%20Map.md).

We must face off against a [Terromorph](Terromorph.md). An alien species seemingly designed to prevent humans from growing too large (they are infamous for sprouting up wherever humans have lived for 70-100 years). It is implied at this point that they may be the result of a mankind invention by the now defunct â€˜[UC XenoResearch](UC%20XenoResearch)' team - the leader of whom was executed at the end of the Colony War when a legion of [Terromorph](Terromorph.md)s destroyed the city of [Londinion](Londinion).

The (implied) daughter  of this executed leader helps us to kill the [Terromorph](Terromorph.md) using the defence system of the base on Tei Ceti II that we were sent to help.

The alien was bigged up to be a major danger, but I barely saw it before the defense system killed it for me. Perhaps players were expected to try and fight the creature themselves instead of doing the optional objective of starting up all the turrets. While lacking in dialogue, gameplay [Role-Playing](Role-Playing.md) options such as this still exist in Starfield, often tied to the ability to control nearby turrets and robots, like in Fallout 3 and 4.

I agree with reviews that the faction quests are better than the main story. This is already more exciting.

The lore is more intriguing, like there's actual intrigue into what the [Terromorph](Terromorph.md)s are, who made them, how do they travel the universe, and who is this woman helping us that worked on the [UC XenoResearch](UC%20XenoResearch) team, has a classified file, and shares the same last name as an executed General.
