The player is introduced to the UC Vanguard through the main story. This is our first faction, and appears to be a military group, somewhat filling the role of the Fighter’s Guild, or the Imperial Legion in Morrowind. They offer paid mercenary work such as working on behalf of the UC Navy to hunt pirates.

UC Vanguard museum isn’t even hiding the propaganda. Love the use of cold corporate infographic “art” to drive home that calculative nature.

The [History](History.md) between our time in to the games start in 2330 is told via a museum exhibition. This was very well done in my opinion, reminding me of how a similar conundrum was handled in Morrowind - how do we update the player on what has happened, without forcing them to listen to exposition against their will?

In Morrowind it was done by early MQ characters insisting that you read up on the land's history; it would make sense to understand the locals if you are going to be working with them. 

It was optional, but gave the players that were interested a direct indication that they should (and can) read up on the lore via in-game books that were given to them. 

It is handled similarly in Starfield. The museum exhibition is optional, and we do not need to visit it to progress the MQ, but the player’s interested in the lore will want to.

Your companion will comment on the museum exhibition as well, giving their own input. (However, the AI isn’t the best at positioning itself near the player. The companion will begin offering their thoughts but will be so far away that it was only by the subtitles that I knew they were even saying anything… and by the time I ran up to them to listen, the voice line had ended)
	This has still not been fixed

When joining the UC Vanguard, the player must take an oath. The speech options imply that this may be an important choice, as another faction may not hire me if they know I'm a member of Vanguard. I wonder if this is true.
	*It’s not.

Vanguard tests you based on your piloting skills. How many of the faction’s story quests require space combat? None, the answer is none. It’s only used for radiant missions.
