After getting caught stealing by UC Security in New Atlantis, instead of paying a fine as usual, I was transported to the Vanguard Navy vessel stationed near Mars. From here a side quest began. - this is a very cool opening to a quest that may be hidden from some players who do not commit crimes (unless this quest can be started by other means).
	From reading online, you can start this quest on the side of the Crimson Fleet too.

[Writing](Writing.md): I was selected because of my background as a soldier. Finally! My background has been acknowledged. I had the choice between accepting the mission - to go undercover into the Crimson Fleet - or to serve a jail sentence. Of course, I chose the smart option and became a secret UC agent.

The [NasaPunk](NasaPunk.md) style is in full effect upon the Vanguard vessel. The ship interior blends modern Navy design with the control rooms seen within 1960s-80s Nasa, and the interiors of the ISS.  

You can also be arrested in space by the UC to start the SysDef Faction Quest. 
Refusing the offer is considered equivalent to accepting the Crimson Fleets' offer, and despite paying your fine and serving your sentence, UC SysDef will now treat you as an enemy and attack you on sight. Even better, as we haven't talked to the Crimson Fleet yet, they too are hostile, meaning that anytime we stumble across the two fighting, they team up and focus on us.
Terrible for [Role-Playing](Role-Playing.md). I served my time (for stealing a coffee cup, may I add) and now the System Defence contingent of the [United_Colonies](United_Colonies.md) Navy treats me as a Kill On Sight hostile? 
Even though I’ve completed the [•UC Vanguard Mission List](•UC%20Vanguard%20Mission%20List.md) and become an official citizen? Wow, just wow. Well thought out. Either bend the knee and become their lackey, or they will murder you. 
	You know what, this is the exact consequence I want, actually, I just wish it was made clear in the dialogue. It makes sense that they'd want to kill you, as you already know that they're looking to hire criminals to infiltrate the Crimson Fleet, which is a security risk and a potential scandal if they don't silence you. Ikande should've made this clear rather than the option seemingly being to pay our sentence in jail as normal.

UC SysDef mentions selling Aurora bait and consequences - you cannot sell the Aurora even if you wanted to. The cargo quest item is registered with the UC so that it doesn’t flag as contraband, and this conveniently holds up in Freestar space too, even over Neon City.
