## Episode 2 Structure
### Plan:

###### 1. Discuss new updates 
- [Difficulty_options](New%20Updates/Difficulty_options.md)
- [Ground_vehicles](New%20Updates/Ground_vehicles.md)
- [Local_Maps](New%20Updates/Local_Maps.md)
- [Tracker's_Alliance](New%20Updates/Tracker's_Alliance.md)
- [Creation_Club_integration](New%20Updates/Creation_Club_integration.md)
- [Bug_Fixes&Other_Changes](New%20Updates/Bug_Fixes&Other_Changes.md) 
###### 2. Main Quest
- Characters
- Motivations
- Themes
- Protagonists
- Antagonists
- [•Factions](Factions/•Factions.md)
- How does the side content tie in
- How ‘impactful’ is the story on the universe (will there be any changes once it is done, or is it self-contained?)
- [NG+](Gameplay%20Systems/NG+.md) implications

Where it makes sense, discuss relevant [•Gameplay_Systems](Gameplay%20Systems/•Gameplay_Systems.md): 
- [HUD+UI](Presentation/HUD+UI.md)
- [Advanced_Combat](Gameplay%20Systems/Advanced_Combat.md) ([Starborn](Main%20Quest/Starborn.md) powers and movement)
- [Crafting](Gameplay%20Systems/Crafting.md)
- [Surveying](Gameplay%20Systems/Surveying.md)/Scanning/Resource collection
- [Planets](Presentation/Planets.md) and planet variety, creatures, exploration, etc. (somewhat covered in Episode 1)
- Is [•Exploring](Exploring/•Exploring.md) fun? Does it have the same addictive ‘let me just get to this next compass marker’ feeling of other Beth games?
- [Outpost_Management](Gameplay%20Systems/Outpost_Management.md)
- [Space_Gameplay](Gameplay%20Systems/Space_Gameplay.md) (flying / traversal / combat)
- [Travelling](Exploring/Travelling.md) (basically all fast travel)
- Game [Role-Playing](Gameplay%20Systems/Role-Playing.md) (Can you play and progress entirely passive? Can you kill everyone? - Answer is no lol)
- Do repeat play-throughs reward player experience (.ie, in FONV, the player follows the recommended route of Primm, Nipton, Boulder City, Vegas, but can rush to Vegas in a new play-through once they are confident with the game mechanics)
- [•Cities](Cities/•Cities.md) - layout, size, number of people, feel real or too small.
