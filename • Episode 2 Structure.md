### Plan:

###### 1. Discuss new updates 
- [[Difficulty options]]
- [[Ground vehicles]]
- [[Local Maps]]
- [[Tracker's Alliance]]
- [[Creation Club integration]]
- [[Bug Fixes & Other Changes]]
###### 2. Main Quest
- Characters
- Motivations
- Themes
- Protagonists
- Antagonists
- [[• Factions]]
- How does the side content tie in
- How ‘impactful’ is the story on the universe (will there be any changes once it is done, or is it self-contained?)
- [[NG+]] implications

Where it makes sense, discuss relevant [[• Gameplay Systems]]:
- [[HUD + UI]]
- [[Advanced Combat]] ([[Starborn]] powers and movement)
- [[Crafting]]
- [[Surveying]]/Scanning/Resource collection
- [[Planets]] and planet variety, creatures, exploration, etc. (somewhat covered in Episode 1)
- Is [[• Exploring]] fun? Does it have the same addictive ‘let me just get to this next compass marker’ feeling of other Beth games?
- [[Outpost Management]]
- [[Space Gameplay]] (flying / traversal / combat)
- [[Travelling]] (basically all fast travel)
- Game [[Role-Playing]] (Can you play and progress entirely passive? Can you kill everyone? - Answer is no lol)
- Do repeat play-throughs reward player experience (.ie, in FONV, the player follows the recommended route of Primm, Nipton, Boulder City, Vegas, but can rush to Vegas in a new play-through once they are confident with the game mechanics)
- [[• Cities]] - layout, size, number of people, feel real or too small.
