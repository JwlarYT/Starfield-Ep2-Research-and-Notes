### Plan:

###### 1. Discuss new updates 
- [Difficulty options](Difficulty%20options.md)
- [Ground vehicles](Ground%20vehicles.md)
- [Local Maps](Local%20Maps.md)
- [Tracker's Alliance](Tracker's%20Alliance.md)
- [Creation Club integration](Creation%20Club%20integration.md)
- [Bug Fixes & Other Changes](Bug%20Fixes%20&%20Other%20Changes.md) 
###### 2. Main Quest
- Characters
- Motivations
- Themes
- Protagonists
- Antagonists
- [• Factions](•%20Factions.md)
- How does the side content tie in
- How ‘impactful’ is the story on the universe (will there be any changes once it is done, or is it self-contained?)
- [NG+](NG+.md) implications

Where it makes sense, discuss relevant [• Gameplay Systems](•%20Gameplay%20Systems.md):
- [HUD + UI](HUD%20+%20UI.md)
- [Advanced Combat](Advanced%20Combat.md) ([Starborn](Starborn.md) powers and movement)
- [Crafting](Crafting.md)
- [Surveying](Surveying.md)/Scanning/Resource collection
- [Planets](Planets.md) and planet variety, creatures, exploration, etc. (somewhat covered in Episode 1)
- Is [• Exploring](•%20Exploring.md) fun? Does it have the same addictive ‘let me just get to this next compass marker’ feeling of other Beth games?
- [Outpost Management](Outpost%20Management.md)
- [Space Gameplay](Space%20Gameplay.md) (flying / traversal / combat)
- [Travelling](Travelling.md) (basically all fast travel)
- Game [Role-Playing](Role-Playing.md) (Can you play and progress entirely passive? Can you kill everyone? - Answer is no lol)
- Do repeat play-throughs reward player experience (.ie, in FONV, the player follows the recommended route of Primm, Nipton, Boulder City, Vegas, but can rush to Vegas in a new play-through once they are confident with the game mechanics)
- [• Cities](•%20Cities.md) - layout, size, number of people, feel real or too small.
