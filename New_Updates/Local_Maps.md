#### Before update critiques
Arguments about the old maps being poor are true, the planetary surface maps are next to useless, but once you learn that the scanner will give you a guided path to your destination, it becomes a lot easier. You can use the scanner to locate distant locations to explore too. It really is an “all in one” system to aid navigation, even though it is first introduced to the player as a means to locate resources.

I am really missing the local maps, especially for caves and outposts. It can be difficult to know if you have explored the entire structure. Especially with the caves where you’ll want to know if you have found each resource in there. Caves and mines are often the only places you can find the rarer resources of a planet, and it can be annoying not knowing if you have explored every corner, or if you have missed a bit.

#### After update 

New local maps negate scanner temple search mechanic, not much lost.

New surface maps highlight exactly why these were not included in the game on launch. The weakness of the algorithm and the barrenness of planet surfaces are on full display. Miles of nothing but repeating assets, a few metres away from each other, all positioned on a perfect grid.

Flora doesn’t show up on them, so they aren’t even finished, unless this was an optimisation choice. Perhaps low LOD versions of the flora were not created, like they had to be for Skyrim’s map.

[Neon_City](../Cities/Neon_City.md)’s local map is the only one that isn’t just the normal surface map view. Dungeon maps in this view would’ve been nice, especially if they could integrate some more 3D. I realise that I have just redesigned the Daggerfall map, but that map would be great with some modern controls and QOL.
	[The_Well](../Cities/The_Well.md)'s map is exactly that! A floor plan shown in 3D, very reminiscent of Daggerfall but with modern controls making it easy to look around it! Why don’t dungeons use this???
