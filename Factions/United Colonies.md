UC is British empire / Imperials in Star Wars. In NA you get to see the propaganda and prosperity (as well as class divide) that that brings. Slow, rigid, uniform, authoritarian and sacrifices personal liberty for stability.

UC and [MAST](MAST.md) appear to be falling apart at the seams in some lore entries in dungeons and such, but we don't see much of that in New Atlantis. Appear strong when you are weak, I guess.
	Inefficiencies of bureaucracy, etc.

UC is too big for its own good and poorly organised. The surplus store in [The Well](The%20Well.md) reflects this, where loads and expensive equipment often fall through bureaucratic cracks, left to rot in a warehouse until the UC Surplus owner buys it all in bulk for a huge discount.

An attempt to be a better egalitarian place, hence all the people saying it's a utopia-but-really-dystopia (because [The Well](The%20Well.md). )
Obviously bureaucratic. Not necessarily authoritarian, but common references to [Starship troopers](Starship%20troopers.md)' government which is supposed to be authoritarian, because of the "do X to become a citizen" thing. Also seen references to technocracy (due to MAST).

-They live in what's evidently a very sleek-looking city, everything is neat, clean well-kept.
-The well is an underground, hidden-away place of obvious misery. the generic living conditions being far, far less than on the surface. It's also far more grimey, with more failing appliances exposed steam vents, faulty electrics and so on. Except from a UC guard (i think it was) nobody ever mentions the Well as something that exists, and inside the well people do talk about the noteworthily worse conditions versus the surface.
-You're supposed to actively work in the Vanguard (or other governmental party) for 10 or so years before you're recognized as a proper UC citizen. Something which is required before you're even allowed to purchase a home in New Atlantis.
-Iirc, they are the only faction that have what amount to a whole espionage network that actively keeps tabs on the other factions, this is implied when you enter Aegis.
-They are presently the only faction that has an actual military fleet (or, what's supposed to be a vast military branch of government).
-They have a propaganda-style 'museum' to explain recent history, with a notable air of 'Freestar bad'.
at some point in the game you even learn they keep a criminal locked up behind a very big locked door as a secret, also towards the other factions.
