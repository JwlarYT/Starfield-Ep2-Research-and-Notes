[Freestar_Collective](Freestar_Collective.md) parallels America. It started as a colony for the [United_Colonies](United_Colonies.md) (British Empire), and then when the UC imposed too much onto the FC, they fought for their independence across two wars.

Factions aren't well enforced to the point where people are so unaware of them.[Inhibited_by_weak_gameplay](Inhibited_by_weak_gameplay.md)
I would start by marking the boundaries of the regions of the settled systems in the map. Follow that up with different regulatory rules around stolen / illegal goods - basically expanding the Kryx / Den selling behaviour further. Probably start tailoring the random encounters in each region to reflect a story and then go from there.

These will make the underlying differences and conflict become a lot more visible.

Just other examples of human governments. Humans are flawed, therefore the systems are flawed, so it's not a perfect utopia, but neither is it a dystopia.

 The fact that our decision to fully commit to a faction didn’t in some way inhibit the [affinity](Companions.md) we could achieve with the others made them feel meaningless beyond a very shallow aesthetic genre variety.
