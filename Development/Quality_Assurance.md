A general feeling of a lack of QA. Doors into some settlements take a long time to open as they play their animation (such as the [Cydonia](Cities/Cydonia.md) airlock). These are cool designs, the first time around, that fit the realism aesthetic of the world design, but do we need a 5-second pause every time? 

There’s an awkward pause when using the [grav drive](Exploring/Travelling.md) in third person, too, where we must wait for the first-person animation to play before anything happens, making it feel like our input wasn’t received/isn’t working for a few seconds. These are tiny blocks of time, but they all add up to a feeling of time wasting. Any time the player is free to put down the controller during active gameplay (i.e., not during a story cutscene or critical dialogue) screams to me as a time waste that should at least be reduced a tad.

Colonists at a [civilian outpost](Exploring/Points_of_Interest.md) on a moon with 0% oxygen and low gravity are casually walking around without a spacesuit…

At a Colonist Random [POI](Exploring/Points_of_Interest.md), I received a [radiant quest](Gameplay%20Systems/Radiant_Quests.md) asking us to place a few sensors on nearby gas vents to check how volatile the gases given off are. The quest fulfillment requirement clearly asks for 8 sensors. I approach the first one, only 80 metres away, and the quest is completed, the 2nd stage of the quest showing that I only needed to do one.

At some point the [radiant quest](Gameplay%20Systems/Radiant_Quests.md) designer must’ve been informed, or made the decision themselves that 8 was too much, and chose to lower it to 1, but then forgot to update the journal entry. More amusing, and this will sound hypocritical compared with the scanning critique, but 1 is actually too little. How busy is this colonist that they couldn’t hop this miniscule distance, a task that took me 30 seconds, on their own. 2-4 I could understand, especially if they were further away. This got a laugh out of me for how easy it was. It might just be the easiest fetch quest of my life, it’s the kind of thing you’d expect to see in a parody game. I spent more time playing around in the zero G football pitch nearby!

Colonists also have terrible pathing and one got stuck in a desk table while sitting down. QA must’ve been burning down at the time.

A lot of set pieces needed a bit of massaging, like Neshar’s arrest as we approach [Neon_City](Cities/Neon_City.md)’s central elevator into the city proper for the first time. [Immersion](Presentation/Immersion.md) is lost when the matrix spaghetti code is clearly visible to the player, much like when an NPC cannot speak while acting. Akin to the Sims, we are free to see the stack of actions requested of the character. 
	- Kneel on the floor, 
	- listen to the voice line, 
	- stand up, 
	- turn to the NPC, 
	- reply with the voice line. I
It’s challenging to feign believability when these moments happen. It isn’t always the case, either, which is why I’m confident in calling it a Quality Control issue, not a technical difficulty.

'Booth' on [Cydonia](Cities/Cydonia.md)’s VO has a helmet filter on it, but he is not wearing one. QC issue.

Credits have a copy-paste error for the Shattered Space voice actors. If the attention to detail is so low that someone can make a blatant copy-and-paste error and not catch it before release, it is a bad sign for the overall quality control at the studio.
