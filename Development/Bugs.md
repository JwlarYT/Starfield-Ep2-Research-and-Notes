AI pathing can sometimes break. My companion sometimes will walk to an unintended area before miraculously warping to where the game wants them to be.

So some of the expected Bethesda bugs are here as expected. One can only imagine how bad the game mustâ€™ve been before its originally intended release date.

Past the poor optimization, I have not noticed any game breaking bugs, or any crashes.
	These become more apparent the long you play. BGS still have not solved the issue of save file bloat slowing performance, adding to glitchiness and eventually regualar crashes (reportedly worse on console). [NG+](../Gameplay_Systems/NG+.md) is used as a band-aid solution, resetting the save file to being fresh.

Same Havok physics system as before, with all the same bugs, like ragdolls getting stuck inside props. Literally a bug from Oblivion.

Bugs (all in one play session):
+ Eklund Site CL25, needed for the Freestar ranger questline, was clipped into an asteroid and could not be accessed.
+ A ship part clipped into the interior of my ship during combat.
+ Standing up during space combat prevented enemy ships from attacking (this may be a general immersion break issue - needs testing).
+ My ship landed upside down in the cutscene. It flipped back afterwards, though.
+ Sound bug with the car

Sometimes crewmembers will get off on a planet and need to be recalled onto the crew from the respective menu screen. Glitch? Or they just hate working for me lol.
