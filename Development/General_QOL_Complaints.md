I wish we could choose to fast travel into the ship and not just into the pilot’s seat. I am more often than not getting up from my seat to dump my planetary resources and loot into the ship’s container.

The [hazard](../Gameplay_Systems/Ailments.md) sound effect is very annoying, especially after maximum damage from the hazard has been sustained. The warning is warranted when the player has time to react, but after I have already received severe lung damage in a sandstorm, I no longer need the persistent beeping. The damage is done; I am aware. At least change the warning to be every minute or something. Also, how does sand penetrate a spacesuit enough to destroy our lungs? A bandana wrapped around the mouth is enough protection in real life.
NPCs don’t react to them either, and getting locked into dialogue during a weather event will lead to the player receiving an adverse prognosis effect against their will. ([Shaw gang confrontation](../Main_Quest/The_Empty_Nest.md)). I'm wearing a spacesuit, while they’re in plain clothes, yet I’m the one whose lungs are being shredded.
