The number of support studios is excessive, but necessary for the hundreds of high-definition 3D models and textures that had to be created. 
Said studios would have only been following the Art Director's instructions anyway, so the racist’s dialogue that, because some Indian and Chinese people worked on the game, it was always going to be bad, is stupid. 

I am 99.99% confident in saying that these support studios never spent any time at all in the Creation Engine Dev kit, and only spent time developing art assets and animations to be sent to BGS, where the actual creation of the game itself was done in-house. 

I have experience in this because Western Design Houses also do this very thing. Suppose we need to create renders of an interior design, for example. In that case, we will design it ourselves in 2D wireframes and then outsource the work to a cheaper firm, located in Italy, which will send back the 3D renders. 
We’ll often have a back-and-forth process, making any minor amendments to lighting, camera angles, and so on. Receive the final HD renders and then incorporate them into the final design as needed for the client. At no point do the support studios interact with the final design or even really know what their work was for; they only have to do what is asked of them.

Outsourcing is a result of a connected global economy that prioritises maximum profits and minimal time. For the developers at BGS to achieve a better work-life balance, one of the best in the industry, outsourcing is required to enable this. Otherwise, high staff numbers and longer hours would be needed for them to create the same amount of work.

Peoplemakegames video about outsourcing slavery and relays how outsourcing is linked to art, animations etc. worth mentioning in passing about the outsourcing of crunch, but also how while important, it isn’t relevant further to the critique.
