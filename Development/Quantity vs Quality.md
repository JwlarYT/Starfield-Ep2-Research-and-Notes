It's as if Bethesda poured lots into:
+ **Quest implementation**, the very basics of steps and locations.
+ **Assets**, making lots of items, biomes, creatures, voice lines, etc.

And comparatively little into:
+ **Narrative**, for things like better choice and consequence in storylines for the implementers to implement, better and more companion interactions, more coherent world building, more impactful NG+ deviations, etc.

The fact is, an entry-level employee can implement quests, just as any modder can. A small army of entry-level 3d modellers can produce tons of assets, just as a modder can. Whereas narrative requires skilled writers, the narrative direction in Starfield is mediocre at best and scatterbrained at worst, resulting in the game's downfall.

Even if there is tons of content, even if 85% of the glass is full of content, the game can still come out mediocre if the remaining 15% of polish, pushing the envelope that should make that content memorable, is mid and undermines the content in a pervasive, all-encompassing manner.

Compared to games like:

**Cyberpunk**: much stronger narrative direction, much stronger engineering on cutting-edge rendering tech to push AAA visuals and spectacle.

**Star Citizen**: sure, years of development hell, but it all went into engineering to tackle 'unrealistic expectations no publisher wanted to solve' and it shows.

**Baldur's Gate III**: Much stronger narrative direction for companions.

**Elden Ring**: Much tighter world design.

**Skyrim**: Better focused world design in general, better exploration even!
