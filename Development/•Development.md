[Inside Starfield: how Bethesda's “NASA punk” epic became the biggest Xbox game in a decade](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/starfield-todd-howard-interview)
GQ, Sam White, Aug 2023

Codenamed Genesis – jointly inspired by the Bible and Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan – Starfield formally came to life a decade ago. Howard loved the name so much that he trademarked it before anyone else could. It was 2013, two years before finishing development on Fallout 4, and he had to answer “the big question mark” of what the studio would commit centuries of manpower to make next. “We realised if we didn’t make Starfield the next thing,” he says, “we’d probably never do it.”

“I thought we would find the answers faster,” Howard admits, explaining that Starfield only “clicked” into feeling fun to play as late as last year. One public delay (and several private ones) prolonged things further. “It's the game flow,” he says. “We whittle away on these lumps of clay, and make them better. But there’s a magic to that.”

Design director Emil Pagliarulo likens pre-production to “the land of milk and honey” compared to the harsh reality of making a game where entire new technologies had to be coded and designed from nothing. 

He summarises imagining a universe from nothing, down to the mundane. “We had to concept art the trash cans.”

Starfield is science fiction at its most romantic – the warmth of golden-age 1960s space aspirations in its heart, and the familiar feel of a BGS game in its veins. Art director Istvan Pely coined the term “NASA Punk” for its visual language – all clunk and clutter. “There aren’t holograms everywhere. It's got buttons. They're tactile. You want to press ’em,” he says, squishing the air with his thumb. “Don’t think of it as futuristic. Think of it as a period piece. These are things that happened.” Despite setting the game 300 years in the future, he didn’t want it to feel like humanity had changed its nature: “People are still people. They’re still messy.”

Looking around inside the ship, Howard gets me to go into photo mode. “Zoom in on that a second,” he asks, pointing at one of the panels on the walls, “because this is where Istvan is a fucking genius.” Every knob, button and screen has minuscule hand-crafted icons and scripture. Howard is standing up now, arms outstretched in front of me. “That is mental!”

 “A real city isn't just designed and built, it evolves over time,” Pely says. “It's not just a singular designer's vision, because then it's not going to feel real. It's going to feel like a theme park.”

Pagliarulo, who’s responsible for **overseeing all the writing and quest design**, is a raised-Catholic Southie from Boston. “I swear to God, I’ve never reflected so much while making a game,” he says. He’s not been practising religiously for the longest time, but Starfield still push-pulled him from atheist to agnostic and back again throughout the development process. “Is there anything out there but blackness? We're tackling some pretty big themes that your average shooter probably doesn't get into,” he says. “It’s really affected me personally.”

It took a long time to nail the variety of distinct flavours and storylines, inspired by all corners of the sci-fi genre, from [Battlestar Galactica](Battlestar%20Galactica) to Star Wars and even to [Deadwood](Deadwood) in space, but also keep it cohesive. “We have this ability to affect a player on both an emotional and intellectual level, and you're constantly deciding which one to do,” Pagliarulo says. “Go too far down the emotional path and it can get cringy. Go too far into the intellectual and it becomes too pointy-headed.”

Howard admits he’s not sure whether everyone will like the change in rhythm. “It’s not the same as dropping you in a world like Skyrim,” he says. “You wander totally differently.” But it’s in those moments of wandering where the game can be the most empty, and the most beautiful. All of the tech and art comes to fruition when I land on a distant world and step out of my ship. “I think that moment works almost every time,” Howard says, as a distant gas giant rises above the horizon. Every planet and moon in the game has its own time, orbiting their stars independently. “When you’re looking over the landscape and the star is setting. That’s all somewhat simulated. In this game it just happens.”

It’s wild that a studio can spend hundreds of millions and the better part of a decade developing a game that’s precisely what you’d guess it would be, and also, just a bit worse.

A large corporation like Bethesda will NEVER make anything "unsafe" again. It's not the game developers choosing what they make; it's high-ups who don't see video games as a medium for art, only an asset for their profits. Zenimax started it, and Microsoft guarantees it.

Every decision made was made to make life easier on the developers - content, features, and systems are added or removed based on how hard they are to manage, with no consideration to how something being hard to manage might be counterbalanced by the result being worth it. That's why [NG+](../Gameplay_Systems/NG+.md) choices hardly amount to anything, and it's why choices, in general, hardly amount to anything. It's why perks, traits, and status effects all feel like window dressing. It's why mechs are illegal in Starfield, and levitation is illegal in Oblivion and Skyrim. It's why [recall](../Research/Todd_Howard_Interviews.md) was taken out of The Elder Scrolls. And it's why Starborn powers are just the magic system.

Kirkbride: "Morrowind was a big jazz band, you know? There weren’t a lot of things where we were bright enough to know that we shouldn’t do it."

The whole development timeline seems plagued with issues that left a lot of undercooked parts of the game or ideas that simply didn't live up to what the original pitch was and/or what gamers expect from a Bethesda game.  
I believe that a mix of too many managers, inflated team sizes, and a production deadline constraining how much the engine programmers could actually modify the Creation Engine to have better space travel, all combined, led to what we have now.
Too many cooks in the kitchen. Skyrim worked because a developer could go directly to Todd and make werewolves happen. From what the interviews have showed, that's impossible with how large the studio is now. The tight-knit team of old Bethesda simply can't exist.

BGS feels like a zombie studio stumbling around with a thousand-yard stare, going through the motions of delivering a product. The passion may be there on an individual level (Emil Tweet), but the layers of middle management and symptoms similar to other over-bloated game developers such as 343 Industries and Ubisoft tell us that that passion has been turfed over.
