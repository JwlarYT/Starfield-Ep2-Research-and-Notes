Gore was cut

I don't necessarily want gore, but this attitude they took here explains a lot about how the game turned out how it did. They wanted a certain direction, started down it, realized it was too hard and time-consuming, they were already grinding at a slogs pace due to the growth woes, so they cut it.

They did that with so many aspects of the game, and it shows.

Gore wouldn't have added much to Starfield. The same principle applies to profanity. Both would be incongruous and inconsistent with the tone, setting and themes of the game.

To use a TV show as an analogy, It'd be like Captain Picard in TNG calling everyone "cunts" and chopping off Romulan limbs with a machete. Might feel out of place.

Starfield isn't a survival horror or even an action adventure game. It deals with mature and adult issues and themes that don't need to be splattered in blood, gore, and littered with depictions of dismemberment.

To devil's advocate, no one thinks a bad media with gore and cursing is better than a good media without it. Bad media is bad. If a game has gore and cursing in it though, it necessarily is sacrificing accessibility for theme which is of course always going to make something better since it can invest more into its niches. 

I'm a big diagetic guy and am a stickler for narrative consistency. The less [Ludonarrative dissonance](Ludonarrative%20dissonance.md) a game has to rely on, the more I appreciate it. 

There's terrormorphs, drug addicts, space pirates, outlaws, zealots, raiders, holotapes of people's last words before dying, criminals joking about torturing people. War crimes. You solve 90% of your problems with violence.

More gore is far from any priority Starfield needs in its top 5 issues but it shouldn't shy away from depicting an amount of realism that it's narrative directly engages with in a way that fits. Just keep it consistent to the relevant scene/characters.
