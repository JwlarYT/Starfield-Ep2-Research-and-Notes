Modding is dying on the nexus, partly due to paid mods on the Creation Club

"Just like every other Bethesda game, I wait at least five years to play it."
1. You can buy it with all the DLC for like $5. 
2. It's been patched and improved dramatically. 
3. Community mods and support take it to the next level.

The [[Creation Club integration]] and Mods fix many of the game’s shortcomings for Bethesda. They rely on modders to improve their game.
Yes it’s great that they provide some of the best modding support in the industry (although it has been getting worse since Skyrim with poor documentation for modders on how to use the new tools), but that doesn’t mean we should accept a mediocre full price title just because the mods will be great. 

Modders are bailing on Starfield in large part due to BGS breaking the engine to make some of the new mechanics work. ElminsterAU, the original developer of xEdit, THE go-to conflict detector and editor for Bethesda game mods, points to specific coding errors and incompatibilities within Creation Engine 2.

With the amount of paid content vastly surpassing what the base game offered (Watchtower), it feels as though I am not playing a completed £70 title, but rather a framework for developers. It’s Roblox, or Fortnite - except they’re both free to play.

Which isn’t to say Starfield should be free; there's way more on offer than those two examples. However, I can’t help but feel that Starfield’s nature as a barebones structure, which even its most hardcore fans will mod into oblivion to enjoy it to its maximum, says a lot.

I didn’t need to mod Morrowind to make it one of my favourite games ever, I played that vanilla. 

Outside of HD patches and/or engine rewrites, that’s how I prefer to play my games. Let the game rest on its laurels, not the combined Evergreen Crowns of the fans’ creativity.

Forcing systems into mods means you are reliant on the modder’s tastes, oftentimes fighting with the games [[Immersion|tone]]. Had BGS taken the time to improve these systems themselves (like abandoning gore) then you would not be left with mods that meet the goal 90% of the way, but fall at the final hurdle. Gore field for example restores that viscera to gunfights, but is way too over the top, feeling like Fallout’s Bloody Mess perk is left permanently stuck on.
As well as bringing some immersion breaking SFX (head splatter sound).

Body stripping was removed for two reasons. One the value and weight of the loot, and two not wanting to spend the time to animate corpse decay in extreme environments. Mods restore this, and this is the exact mentality BGS brought when cutting features: “we can cut it to save time, and modders will add it back in for those that want it”. Rather than spend the time needed to fix the design and technical problems. Even AAA companies with 600+ interns employees need to rely on the passion of individual modders…

The most popular fan patch was just ceased due to lack of interest in the game

The state of another, the 2nd most endorsed mod in the last year. Ceased again.
As per the author : 
	Bethesda has recently allowed paid mods to be tagged as Achievement Friendly on the Creations platform, with no plans to make accommodations for free mods. They are also allowing mod authors to re-upload free mods as paid mods to get the Achievement Friendly tag, at the request of console mod users.  
	This effectively disincentivizes free mods from being published, as it will push console users to stick with purely paid load orders in order to continue earning achievements. This was the final nail in the coffin for my interest in Starfield, and I no longer wish to support the money-first modding ecosystem that Bethesda is attempting to create.  
	Thank you to everyone who has used my work. I am happy to have been able to share things which have improved the game for so many people.

Part of what makes the crowd so uncanny is the optimsations made to their graphical quality versus named NPCs. Mods like this help to lessen the issue.
As per the author, the ambient occlusion maps were unfinished: 
	The baked AO maps for crowd NPCs that were in the game seem incomplete. Only two of them had any amount of shading applied to the eyes and the rest had none. I merely went in and painted in AO into all the maps so that there's an appropriate amount of shading around their eyes so they no longer seem to glow.
2 years on, and they still are unfinished. They also note that their is not performance impact as this tech is already used in game, only it isnt rendered properly on the crowd.

Fixes crowd staring and NPC routines feel more natural. Better illusion.

Todd thought that if they sold a huge empty sandbox, that modders would build sandcastles overtime. Pretty much building a game for them.
And you know what, he was right. Build it and they will come. Not in the numbers of the previous games, but the ones that have stuck around are producing mods to a quality not commonly seen their either. (Watchtower etc). Financial incentive does a lot to motivate.

A game like Minecraft or LittleBigPlanet is meant as a canvas. Starfield is not.

Reddit: "There actually was. Skyrim and before they actually provided a good amount of support and maintained knowledge bases for actually doing modding. Making cells, proper navmesh work, how to script NPCs etc etc. After that however we've basically been going off of old Skyrim knowledge and stumbling around in regards to any changes Bethesda makes. Just look at the first years trying to figure out precombines in FO4.

Bethesda still provides the tools, but the manual is still stuck in years past with no explanation on new tools or what doesnt work anymore. Their actual support compared to Paradox or Larian is an absolute laughingstock."

It still blows my mind that people will claim SF wasn't unfinished at launch but then rush to install a whole laundry list of mods to make the game more enjoyable.
	The idea that we should need mods to fix a "AAA next-gen" game is absurd. That people should be paying for content mods on top of already paying $70.00 for a mainline game is fucken absurd.

[89% of Creations are free, 11% are paid](https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1kyfbnu/comment/muwwn8m/?context=3)
The problem is that the actual in game UI is terrible for searching through creations. It makes the mod selection seem limited to mostly paid mods, which is a bit scummy imo.

Yahoo! News, Eddie Makuch, April 2015

*"Bethesda went on to say...only 8 per cent of Skyrim players have ever used a mod, and fewer than 1 per cent has ever made one."*
	During the original backlash to Bethesda's attempt to integrate paid mods through Steam (before they circumvented them completely with the internally hosted Creation Club), according to this Yahoo News article, Bethesda claimed that only 8% of players used mods in 2015.
		Over 10 years later, that number is likely much higher, certainly with the inclusion of console mods and their ease of entry to installation versus the traditional route. 
			Even if we extrapolate heavily, however, that only results in 40-60% of players using mods, which, while possibly being a majority, still appears quite risky to hedge your entire game's bet on.
