Starfield was a victim of poor planning and lack of a focused vision

Tons and tons of time spent procrastinating, being undecided, changing design choices, then realising it didn't work and then reverting back again, realising the engine was outdated and trying to fix the graphics. Basically, this is what happens when there is no core leadership with a solid vision about what the game could be.

My theory is that the idea for Starfield was kicking around in Todd's head for a long time, but he never figured out how it was going to work. Then they started development on the assumption that a Bethesda RPG in space would automatically be brilliant, but the team didn't have a lot of direction. They put work into the engine and the tools, but it took way too long for them to develop a playable build. I think they rushed a lot of the writing and content. Then they just had to do the best they could with the time left. The project probably suffered from a lack of clarity and direction from the beginning, and the promised scope was overly large. 

A storage depot [POI](Exploring/Points_of_Interest.md) had a construction team working on it. They mention living quarters, but there are none to be seen nearby. There is a disconnect between the [writers](Writing/Writing.md) and the [level designers](Exploring/Level_Design.md).

Helium fuel is placed as loot at the end of some [dungeons](Exploring/Points_of_Interest.md), reinforcing that [fuel](Exploring/Travelling.md) shortages were going to be the prime reason why a player would land on a planet and [explore](Exploring/•Exploring.md). Also explains why humans are EVERYWHERE. The infrastructure is necessary so that the player won’t be stranded.

A few characters, even including Walter Stroud have cut together Youtube-poop style voice lines regarding Aurora. This drug must have been redesigned or renamed at some point fairly late in production, if the lines could not be re-recorded so easily. Designing a game with so much volume of writing on the fly is a risky manoeuvre. Perhaps it would have been more effective to plan some of this out better…

Found Sonny Di Falco’s island when hopping star systems for [Final_Glimpses](../Main_Quest/Final_Glimpses.md). This is the only unique dungeon in the game that is not tied to a quest. Even the MQ uses the damn randomised POI dungeons. 
Sonny was a high-ranking drug smuggler who claimed that Vector, a leader in the Crimson Pirates, was a puppet. You can find him dead in bed, the place overrun with pirates - his ego didn’t work out for him. 
Was this a dungeon for a cut quest that was then placed on a random planet? Because the atmosphere has no oxygen and there’s low gravity, despite the pleasure resort having an outdoor bar and pool. No music plays either, possibly highlighting it as unfinished and missing music triggers.

They had a messy creative process and didn't have clear direction.
Is it a survival game, space sim or space-themed Fallout? These game types require different [•Gameplay_Systems](../Gameplay_Systems/•Gameplay_Systems.md) and incentives. You can see how Starfield tries to have it all, but many systems don't quite fit well.

You can build [bases](../Gameplay_Systems/Outpost_Management.md), but everything you can [craft](../Gameplay_Systems/Crafting.md), you can buy more easily. Even selling goods is tedious due to shop money limits and no sell automation. There isn't really a reason to make hundreds of some components, so why do we even have manufacturing?

There is a fuel mechanic, Helium-3 stations, but clearly it is not the resource management version where you have to refuel to travel. [Cut_Content](Development/Cut_Content.md)

All the content is concentrated into a very limited space in space, just dozen of systems. For exploration, you'd want to space it out, make long trips to the edges of space worthwhile. [Star-System_Map](../Gameplay_Systems/Star-System_Map.md)

The only reason I can see [Ailments](../Gameplay_Systems/Ailments.md) not being cut is that they worked so hard on it, same with the surviving fuel distance limiter mechanic. They just neutered them so hard, scared to add just a bit of conflict for the player to navigate.

Bethesda needs to revise their development methodologies, otherwise their games will end up losing more and more focus, which in turn ends up dividing the player base even further.
