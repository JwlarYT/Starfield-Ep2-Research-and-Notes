“Trust the science.” Science has shown that introducing a virus to control a population will initially work, but eventually the hosts develop resistance and the virus loses virulence. Example: attempts to control invasive rabbit populations using a virus in Australia, which failed. Also, imagine if the virus jumped to other alien species and the impact that would have! However, invasive species can be controlled at tolerable levels with the introduction of an appropriate predator, who maintain an evolutionary arms race with each other. Risks, of course, include the predator preying on other species, as happened when mongoose sent to eat rats in Hawaii ate native nene eggs too. Knowing all of these, I chose Aceles as the most manageable long term solution and got berated for it. Honestly, the best choice would be to both the virus and the predator at the same time - a shotgun approach can often do wonders (hence using multiple antibiotics to fight an infection rather than just one to let the bacteria evolve around. But whatever. UC knows “science“ better than me!

1) cloning and animal husbandry are sciences too 
2) of course the UC vet is the one asking me to unleash a supervirus, return to type I guess. 

The UC is still covering up a lot of what they were doing with terrormorphs, cloning, and bio weapons.

I did not trust a virus, something I couldn’t see or fight and take on faith.

The big problem with the UC Vanguard questline decision is that you as the player have perfect knowledge, you just don't find out until later that both options are successful. The unity straight up tells you what happens in your universe when you leave and in both situations the terrormorph threat to humanity is ended.

The only difference between the two in regard to the story is how fast you get there. Your choices aren't fast and risky or slow and safe, it's actually fast and safe or slow and safe. So your companions are technically correct in complaining when you don't choose the microbe, but the game withholds this information until you unity jump.

I think the entire Vanguard questline dialogue should have been re-written to reflect what actually happens when you choose either the microbe or the Aceles. What really happens is if you choose the microbe then all terrormorphs you find in the future will be weaker, have less health and die faster. If you choose the Aceles then the UC and FC send troops to escort physical Aceles in-game to random planets and anytime you encounter a terrormorph you have a chance for there to be an Aceles there fighting it in-game.

The terrormorph is already a highly intelligent invasive species on other planets that is implied to dominate lesser lifeforms with pheromones and readily attack any sentient life. The Aceles, by comparison, even though aside from Terrormorphs, we know little of their dietary preferences, are mostly docile creatures that can thrive almost anywhere. They existed on multiple planets already before humanity overfarmed them. They are far less likely to cause as much ecological devastation as the terrormorphs themselves. Beyond this, if they become a problem, they are active resources as excellent sources of nutrition and durable materials.

Furthermore, the microbes also present a similar ecological risk anyway. The mutation risk doesn't only apply to humanity.

It's odd the microbe solution is presented as an all or nothing approach as if there's only one single way to go about it. Also odd they consider the Aceles as some kind of ecological manipulation when they are only endangered because humans overfarmed them in the first place.

The other thing that I didn’t like about it, is that I was in there, with a non constellation companion, and we all came to the decision together about the aceles. I just simply stated I thought it would be the best decision. Then all of a sudden everyone in constellation suddenly knows all of the details of the encounter and also they say that I alone made the decision even though it was the UC board.

Knowing that the aceles eat the heat leeches and terrormorphs, and the terrormorphs growth cycle is knowledge they didn't have before turning the aceles into food.

The microbe also does not eliminate terrormorphs forever either, there will definitely be some resistant ones that will then require a long term escalation of finding new microbes to kill the newly resistant ones.

Managed properly the aceles will provide a natural control option while also becoming a sustainable food source. And also brings long term cooperation between factions.

Neither option will have a 100% elimination solution, but a well managed aceles option definitely has more upside.

It comes down to eliminating an existential threat to humanity vs managing it.

The microbes literally eliminate terrormorphs forever. Aceles just manage the population so it isn't a problem, but makes no guarantee they won't return if the Aceles get turned into food again.

What disturbs me is how flippant everyone is about genocide. You already thought aceles were extinct, maybe stop screwing with nature? And what wrong with a two pronged solution? Why is it only one or the other?
	My real plan would be to start with Aceles and test the microbe in small areas with extreme terrormorph environments. After a few years of microbe testing and Aceles fighting, we could make the microbe more widespread.
