The premise behind Entangled is intriguing, involving the switching between two universes: one where an experiment went horribly wrong and another where it was contained within minutes. 
Callback to the Dunwich Building in Fallout 3.

The scientists are way too fast to accept our multiverse theory though. [[Constellation]], who are explorers, are struggling to wrap their heads around this, and suddenly these gals are a-okay with it? No questions asked? They say they’re for science, but they’re swift to believe the first hairbrained reasoning given to them.
	The director suddenly knows how multiverses work, as if it’s an everyday occurrence?! Talking about the planet being a closed system held in two states, and that we have to choose which one to save?! She’s got 29 years in quantum physics, if anything, that should make her more wary of all this, not suddenly the exposition-dumping science goddess of the multiverse!

Way to suddenly force the trolley problem choice on the player instead of letting us discover this on our own as we get closer to shutting down the experiment. 
'Mr. Emil Tell-don't-show' it again. Needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few and all that.

You can tell that more time was spent on this section because it feels more like a world than a game. The locked cabinets in the Doctor's office hold files and her personal alcohol supply, for example, not ARPG random gen’d loot. (Although every item is marked as free to take, which goes against this).

Additionally, we can provide the alternate universe version of the Drs' journal to her with unique dialogue. This is the only responsive dialogue option of its kind I’ve seen so far, and it even comes with a reward of extra medical supplies. 
	Most of the time, the extra dialogue options are simply skill enhancements to provide an additional dialogue that does nothing to advance the quest's plotline in any way. (Like with Hughes earlier in this quest).

Quest eventually evolves into a puzzle platformer, which was enjoyable, before it devolved into a large-scale combat arena slog. Flashbacks of Fallout 4’s arena battles. The less of this the better.

You can save them all by going into both universes and turning off the power at the same time. You can find out about this by discovering Rafael's body and his dropped data slate. Another rare case where an alternate outcome can be realised by fully exploring and interacting with an area. An unfortunately rare happenstance in Starfield.
