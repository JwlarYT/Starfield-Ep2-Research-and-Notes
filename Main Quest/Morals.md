Listen to the words from [The_Hunter](The_Hunter.md), [The_Emissary](The_Emissary.md), [Keeper Aquilus](Keeper%20Aquilus), even [Constellation](Constellation.md) members as they discover the truth. Read the journals of the [The_Pilgrim](The_Pilgrim.md). Piece together all the hints and subtext. 

It's all about facing the ultimate choice: How much are you willing to sacrifice in the quest for [Ultimate_Power](Ultimate_Power.md)?

The more relationships, accomplishments, starships, gear, weapons, houses, credits, or outposts you have, the greater the sacrifice will be.

Will you be like [The_Hunter](The_Hunter.md), sacrifice it all, dismiss each universe as meaningless, and simply chase power?

Will you be like [The_Emissary](The_Emissary.md) and save the [Unity](Unity.md) only for the worthy?

Will you be like [The_Pilgrim](The_Pilgrim.md) and realize that after one or many lives, you should instead enjoy your current universe, stop the chase, and live your life?

That's all good philosophical ideas. But it doesn't make a good story that provides a satisfactory ending.
