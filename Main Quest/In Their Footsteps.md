I have finally met the two [[Starborn]]. [[The Emissary]] who fought us after Neon, a version of Barrett who survived in his universe, with me taking his place as the death on the Eye, and [[The Hunter]], a version of Father Aquilus. They have this meeting every time at this point in the universe, highlighting how many times they have gone through the [[Unity]], and the cyclical nature of doing so.
