Main quests can have multiple solutions, like the computer for Lin and the Galbank situation in Akila. 
+ Make them come quietly through persuasion, sneak in and take them out stealthily to save the hostages, or go in guns blazing and risk the hostages dying.

[Akila_City](Cities/Akila_City.md)'s Galbank's vault is wide open with no security, even when choosing the peaceful solution. The bank is back up and functioning, with the receptionist back at their post, yet the vault is still easily plunderable as if we were meant to take the stealth or violence route. 
All that is needed is for us to inform the receptionist that Sam is here to collect from his family vault. Nothing complicated, but enough to add some actual believability to the only bank in the city (and the entire Star System).
	Don’t worry, Emil’s fixed the problem again with one line of dialogue. The bank manager didn’t hire any guards—a bank with no security, in the game’s replica of the Wild West —brilliant design. Enlightened really.

**Getting Solomon's Map with Cora, stealth or speech.**
Fallout 4 introduced more options during quests, including optional solutions. Previously, optional parts were often used solely to obtain an extra reward, a better outcome, or to skip a speech check and proceed. Starfield continues the updated philosophy of FO4, which helps bring some diversity to the main quest, much needed with the [Unity](Main%20Quest/Unity.md) [NG+](Gameplay%20Systems/NG+.md) model hardwired into the story. 

**Shaw gang confrontation.** 
I'm wearing a spacesuit, while they’re in plain clothes, yet I’m the one whose lungs are being [shredded](Gameplay%20Systems/Ailments.md).
