I have finally met the two [Starborn](Main%20Quest/Starborn.md). [The_Emissary](Main%20Quest/The_Emissary.md) who fought us after Neon, a version of Barrett who survived in his universe, with me taking his place as the death on the Eye, and [The_Hunter](Main%20Quest/The_Hunter.md), a version of Father Aquilus. They have this meeting every time at this point in the universe, highlighting how many times they have gone through the [Unity](Main%20Quest/Unity.md), and the cyclical nature of doing so.
