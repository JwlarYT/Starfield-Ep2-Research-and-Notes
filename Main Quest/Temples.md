Temples should be hidden in pocket dimensions that only are accessable to those who have attuned to an artifact, it wouldn't be that hard to pull off but they were just too lazy

At least later Temple Grinding is optional, with the game acknowledging this by putting the missions in the Misc part of the [[side quests|mission log screen]]. Boss fights against “guardian” [[Starborn]] are a joke - very easy. Also, why are they here? Do they literally go through the Unity and then decide to spend the rest of their life walking around one of the many temples? Hell of a constitution, or possible insanity. 
	^They sit in their ships in orbit first and then come down after the temple has been activated. They are following [[the Emissary]] in gatekeeping [[Starborn]]. A noble yet boring pursuit. They aren't very good at it either seeing as how easily myself and [[The Hunter]] can deal with them.

Needing to go back to Vlad every time to find a new temple is antithetical to this “speedrun” mode. Just let him put them all on our map like with the artefacts.
Alternatively, you can find the temples by [[Travelling]] to a star system and hoping that a temple is there. If it is, the quest to find it will start automatically.

Temples must be such an open secret; it’s a miracle [[Constellation]] didn’t know about them. They can often be found just over a KM from human civilization. [[The Pilgrim]] even used to build a tribal [[religion]].

Temples work like the monks giving you the location of Word Wall, but not really. Word Walls could still be found organically, and the monks would simply point the player in a direction to explore somewhere they might otherwise not have gone or had missed. 
Temples cannot be found organically, so they only exist as a radiant quest to be repeated ad nauseam. They do not fit into the gameplay loop. 

Either you grind for them and die of monotony, or decide to space them out robotically - like “Imma do this faction quest and then one temple, or scan this planet and then do a temple”. Or you ignore them. 
The prospect of gaining the powers through natural exploration and gameplay is impossible, unlike in Skyrim.

The Elder Scrolls is a dungeon crawler with an open world and quests to tie it together. Over time, the open world and quests have taken more precedence, but at its core, it is a dungeon crawler. The monks then, directed the player towards the core gameplay: dungeon crawling. 
Starfield tried to be a grand RPG with dungeon crawling on the side, and it's clear to see that this is not their strong suit. Even if Fallout should've been the perfect franchise to perfect this model in.
It’s an open world in the technical sense, but you rarely interact with it in that way. It’s still a sandbox undoubtedly but the formula is removed from the Bethesda staple. Which isn't to say that BGS *shouldn't* experiment, but that they missed the mark here.

At least with Skyrim is was a different location for each and each location also had other reasons to go there. Other quests, actual loot, enemies to fight, actual sense of accomplishment.

A pain to do them all. A bigger pain to realize you have to do each temple 10 times to max out the skill.
24 is bad, 240 is ridiculous.

Vlad won't give you the last many (10?) temples until you complete the final main story mission at the Masada III temple and get those artifacts off the Hunter and Emissary. I find this one of the weird parts of the game since when you finish that mission everyone says goodbye but now you have to get 10 more powers before going to Unity.

Once you have those final artifacts, Vlad will send you them one at a time and yes, at that point he's in the Lodge. Or as someone said below, if you happen into a system with that temple, the mission will pop up to go the power from the associated artifact. But that won't happen if you didn't collect the several artifacts from the hunter and emissary. I didn't know this my first few times and missed out on those powers before going through.
