Starfield is the most conflict free setting of any video game I've ever played. The great war happened before the game starts. There are no antagonists and if you let the bad guys win what's the outcome? They leave the universe forever. It's a game with no stakes.

The vast depersonalizing nature of interstellar space and the corresponding hugeness and complexity required of any entity capable of spanning it just don't lend themselves authentically to the most-important-guy-in-the-world create-a-character RPG genre
	In Starfield, you are the Most Important Guy for one very simple (and stupid) reason: across the multiverse, you are a giant loser and this is the fist universe in which you have not died.

BGS has never been a  narratively praised studio, they’ve always held back, had over-the-top climatic endings, very few memorable npcs. They’ve done plenty of retcons with plot holes in their previous titles cause they made IPs no one expected to become mainstream and now they’re expanding on the world with each iteration. Their lore in elder scrolls has always been far more interesting than the actual story we’ve had. Their pacing has remained terrible. 
	Starfield isn't proof of BGS' downfall in this regard, but it's arrogant trudge forward as it ignores these faults and fails to right them. Which is funny to say, because they did try with Starfield. They used Will Shen, the communities golden child since they liked Far Harbour.
		Starfield at least tried to fix their faults, with their pacing. They tried to actually add different flavours in approach. I would say starfield is written better than fallout 4 but is that saying a lot when fallout 4 is all promises and meeting none of them?

BGS: Makes games that are famous for being so big that people ignore the main story to do other things.
Also BGS: Makes a game where they expect you to repeat the main story over and over while also not providing any significant changes or build variety that would make you want to play it more than once.
		Then add a skip when you realise this is bad idea, although the skip focuses on the most banal repetitive part of the gameplay loop.

The main storyline has one saving grace at least. It requires the player to make an ideological choice between the [The_Emissary](Main%20Quest/The_Emissary.md), [The_Hunter](Main%20Quest/The_Hunter.md) or neither. 
I think that there is an interesting psycho-dramatic commentary there on an individuals power to pursue a a meaningful existence. 
The multiverse (like capitalist ‘meritocracy’) offers us the illusion that can live any life, be whoever we want to be and achieve whatever dream we set our mind to. [The_Emissary](Main%20Quest/The_Emissary.md) calls us towards order, to restrict and temper our desires, harnessing them for a higher purpose.
[The_Hunter](Main%20Quest/The_Hunter.md) has given in to nihilism, embraced the idea that nothing has meaning beyond the pursuit of our personal power. He calls us to let go. 
The irony is that both of them, like us, are trapped by loops and paralysed by too much possibility.
