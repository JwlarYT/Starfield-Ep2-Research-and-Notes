Can't tell Noel (who is setting up Barrett's funeral) that he is [The Emissary](The%20Emissary.md). The options were “yes”, “sarcastic yes”, and “no”. Where’s “uh, well I’m not really in mourning now because a version of him lives”, or “I never really knew the guy”? (I guess that comes under “no”, but the words chosen for the player are a bit sappy, seeing as I [role-played](Role-Playing.md) someone who had minimal contact with [Constellation](Constellation.md) outside of when it was necessary.)
	We end up telling everyone immediately anyway. 

The funeral was fine. There's not much to add. The characters were sombre enough and stuck to their ethos.
