The big ‘twist’ and forced [companion](Companions.md) death to create emotional engagement. This didn’t work for my character as I had chosen [Introvert](Role-Playing.md) as a background, so companions were a no-go. 

Barret was chosen to be sacrificed, likely because he is the character we met first. We still have the choice to go to the Eye and save him, but then someone in the Lodge will die instead. I assume it will be Sarah as she was the second met. 

[The Hunter](The%20Hunter.md)'a chase through [New Atlantis](New%20Atlantis.md) is expectedly janky which harms the cinematic tension BGS were going for. It’s generally a big issue whenever this is attempted, like the Enclave escape in Fallout 3. 
	(It actually works better there, probably because it’s railroaded down a sewer and there aren't any crowds to block the main team) 
Or the ‘grand’ sieges of Skyrim, where soldiers would get stuck on each other and terrain, etc.

[The Hunter](The%20Hunter.md) was level 55, so fighting him felt futile. I wonder if it is possible to out-level him and beat him? 
He was very powerful, utilising a variety of [Starborn](Starborn.md) powers that caused a series of status effects and weaknesses. In a way, he serves as an advertisement for players to grind temples and progress through the Unity, so they too can attain equal strength. 
	Maybe even beat him in future universes? Need to research. 

He accosts us in space after we successfully escape [New Atlantis](New%20Atlantis.md), but has gained a respect for the player, letting us free 
	(although we can attack him, so I need to test if that changes anything narratively). 
It seems he has resigned that we too are destined to become [Starborn](Starborn.md), and that he should wait and see what happens.
