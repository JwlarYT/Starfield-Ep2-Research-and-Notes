First mission with Sarah has us looking for a man who may have an [Artifacts](Artifacts.md), but likely with no idea what it is. Our lead comes through a member of the [UC Vanguard](United%20Colonies.md). An intergalactic stand-in for the Fighter Guild, a mercenary branch of the military that hires OAP veterans and outsiders. 
We are locked with Sarah from this point, forcing the player to feel like they must complete this mission. They are still free to do what they want, but without the ability to change her or dismiss her, this will feel as if you are deliberately ignoring the plot, for which she will comment, trying to keep the player to the MQ (as mentioned by Pete Hines in his pre-release [Interviews](Interviews.md)).

The MQ does not offer many natural times to go [• Exploring](•%20Exploring.md). I just received a mission on [Mars](Cydonia.md) to go find a missing contact we need to ask some questions to. They have been missing for days, obviously this should be a priority. 

Yet, at the same time, I’m swayed to go explore the Martian surface and help the locals. There are loads of side quests in this game, far more than I can wrap my head around. [Cydonia](Cydonia.md) has 5-10+ easily, and after [• Exploring](•%20Exploring.md) a nearby abandoned fracking base, I stumbled across a dead body with a note attached which began yet another quest.
	This is the Bethesda style some love, the feeling that you can just stumble upon a new quest and begin a new adventure where you did not plan to.
  
I am debating in my head how to play this game. Many reviewers have said to play the MQ first to start “[NG+](NG+.md)” . 
	Pete Hines (Marketing Lead) confirms that “Starfield 'Doesn't Really Even Get Going' Until Players Finish the Main Quest”

		Although in the interview, he also mentions that QA guys had played the game for 80 hours and still not completed the MQ, so it isn’t necessary to enjoy the game - you’ll just have to suspend belief when you are ignoring quests that seem urgent.
			In hindsight, they aren't really pushed as that urgent until the [Starborn](Starborn.md) are introduced. [Constellation](Constellation.md) would like that you do them, but their isn't much insistence that we must at the earliest convienance after we ditch Sarah 

The MQ takes you to the space outside of Venus. Here we are introduced to the cultist [House Va’ruun](House%20Va’ruun) (which sounds like a Morrowind reference lets be honest) and to the [Space stealth](Space%20Gameplay.md) mechanic. Space stealth is achieved by deactivating all primary systems such as shields and weapons, making this a very risky maneuver. This will be handy when facing enemy spacecraft that vastly outlevels the player, or are in numbers that will make a dogfight too dangerous.

Some dialogue options do bypass quest objectives, like the Serpent’s Embrace skips the stealth element in The Old Neighbourhood, although the zealots then give a meta-narrative on how this won't work outside of this single scenario.

We are next sent to an old space port orbiting Earth’s moon. 
Despite the urgency of finding Moara, taking a [moon](Luna.md) detour is still allowed. Of course, preventing the player from doing so would be equally frustrating.
The MQ finally has a written place to explore, but I can’t help but feel that it is misplaced. We are tracking down an informant, and yet Sarah is happy for the PC to say “I want to walk on the Moon!” instead. And she lets us. Still, I was happy to take the guilt-free reason to explore.

[Space combat](Space%20Gameplay.md) with Moara ship - Proof that some [skills](Progression.md) were arbitrarily added to remove game systems? Sarah says we need to target the engines, but this functionality is locked behind the Targeting Control Systems skill. I waited during the battle for a tutorial pop-up to help me find the key, but it never came as I don’t have the skill, which means that I had to play as I intended to destroy the ship, where the game conveniently forced the engines to break just beforehand.
Other new functions are locked too, boost packs and ship thrusters. Even mechanics from the previous games are suddenly locked away with Pickpocketing and the Stealth indicator/meter.

Moara’s ship is taken over by [Ecliptic](Ecliptic.md) mercenaries, who have taken control and are firing at us. Moara is able to message us, so surely he must be locked away elsewhere on the ship, out of sight, perhaps in a cell or hold of some kind. Maybe we can even find him during boarding so that he can help us take out the mercenaries. Nope, he’s in the cockpit. That means they heard him make that message as he is literally right behind the captain's seat… and they did nothing?
	All they had to do was have a punch sound effect and have Moara grunt or tell them to stop to imply that he was hit by a merc who noticed his attempt at subterfuge.
