By choosing to repeat the MQ, you’re choosing to act as a Moron. Sarah constantly exposes how they have no idea what the [[Artifacts]] are, and we can’t simply tell her that they are the key to [[Unity]]. We have to pretend to be that original, ignorant miner. 
If [[NG+]] is going to be the core of your MQ revelation, maybe spend more time bulking that out in your new dialogue options. The [[Starborn]] options that do come up don’t even skip anything, or provide major evidence to [[Constellation]] (unless you choose to [["Skip Main Quest"]] entirely), they boil down to you being a smartass.

[[The Old Neighborhood]] - None of these speech options should even be here! “Oh boy, my first mission”. I have to imagine it’s either said with the most significant degree of irony and sarcasm possible, in which case, how is Sarah not realising that, or the player has terrible [[Unity]] exposure-related dementia.

Really, the lack of any [[Starborn]] dialogue options when talking to [[Constellation]] for the first time is shocking. I have to pretend I’ve only seen one vision, have no idea where the [[Artifacts]] are from and know not a single damn thing about this universe, despite having already lived a whole life here.
