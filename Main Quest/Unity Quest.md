[Keeper Aquilius](The%20Hunter.md) babies us toward the coordinates of the [Unity](Unity.md) with massive leaps of logic that spun my head at first, but are a lot more understandable, seeing as he is literally the retired Hunter. 
Kinda wish we had the option to call him out on these leaps though, it won’t stop him giving us this info, but at least let me [Role-Play](Role-Playing.md) as a sceptic. 
I gave him breadcrumbs, and he produced the exact location we needed. Not very subtle of him.

Emil has learnt the fundamental human capacity to understand and share the feelings of others and wants us to know of his great discovery. The Catherine VA was so excited about her line delivery, lol, as if this was a huge revelation. Empathy! OMG, wow, what a finding!

I can't believe he talked about how much he learnt about [Religion](Religion.md) when writing this MQ, It's the most surface-level understanding of belief systems possible. My favourite is there being a 'religion' (charity really) of Atheists called... The House of Enlightenment. Really on the nose.

Unity follow-up: Sam wants to go, but doesn’t want to leave Cora, and considers it bad parenting to take. 
Cora wants to go regardless, as her dad says, she is a born explorer. 

Andreja is unsure, but doesn't seem keen. 

Sarah doesn’t want to go, but will do so if the player requests. 
	Sarah’s “You’re a respected colleague and I want what’s best for you” sounds edited together, likely as the original line was from the romance. I doubt the romance was ever considered to be mandatory, so this screams laziness. More proof of rushed final years of development, [Poor Planning](Poor%20Planning.md) and rewriting/designing. 
The style of development that saved the company with Morrowind nearly killed the team with Skyrim (and subsequently rewarded them with their most significant success) has finally come back to haunt them. Developing without a strong plan does not work as the company outgrows its core team, especially when circumstances like working from home (WFH) are forced into play without adequate warning.
