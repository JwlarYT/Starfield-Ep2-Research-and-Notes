Artifact Origins: It's true that we don't know anything about who made the artifacts, the temples, and how it all started. For that, I think they are saving it for a DLC, and I think that's fine.

Artefacts spawn in low-level universes exclusively.

I definitely find it a struggle for an in-world reason. Lin for sure treated the player as the expendable new guy. Only she and Heller knew the Vectera dig was for a Constellation contract, and she wasn't going to send her right-hand man into that cavern.

As for Constellation, I can only buy "you're the new guy" reasoning so much. After all, we eventually start building relationships with everyone so wouldn't someone eventually say "hey, let's not use my friend/lover as a guinea pig every time?" We also know Barrett is fine after touching his artifact. And when people in Constellation seem willing to jump into Unity without really knowing what will happen to them, I find it hard to believe they would be scared to touch an artifact.

Obviously, we all know it's because we're the main character. It's just one of those things I don't think too much on lore-wise as it's a gameplay mechanic.

In my opinion, [Constellation](Main%20Quest/Constellation.md) is an adventurers' club first and a scientific organization second, if at all. Despite the "For All, Into the Starfield" tagline, they are really for themselves - the satisfaction of being the first to explore the unknown. Sam Coe has a great line about landing on planets where no one has been before.

I'm not sure how much the pursuit of knowledge for all humanity factors into their mindset. If that was the case, you would think they would bring in entire research teams for something as big as the artifacts. The only legitimate scientists in Constellation are Noel and Barrett. And only Noel is really full-time studying the artifacts.

Walter even points out they have no idea what they are doing with the artifacts and they could be building a bomb in the middle of Jemison, but it doesn't seem to bother anyone else that Constellation is absolutely way out of their league if they actually wanted to study the artifacts and later Unity.

And this right here is an insurmountable problem for me. So far I haven't been able to find a reason why any sane character would touch an artifact more than twice. The first time might have been a fluke, but the second time the vision is a tad more intense and lasts a few seconds longer. A sane person would wonder how many exposures their fragile human brain could take.

You're the guinea pig. Everyone is watching you and waiting to see if there are any adverse problems, i.e. extra arms. But, in a [NG+](Gameplay%20Systems/NG+.md) if you do not do the main quest the [Constellation](Main%20Quest/Constellation.md) members will bring artifacts in and add to the collection. This implies they do touch new artifacts, and they should get powers like Barrett and yourself, they just don't somehow, or refuse to talk about them and refuse to use them.

I like taking Barrett into Temples, because it should give him the same powers as I have, he just only uses his one power from his artifact. Weird, I know
