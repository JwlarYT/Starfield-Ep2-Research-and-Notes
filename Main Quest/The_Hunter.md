Keep jumping through universes to get all powers for yourself

"First time you (we) have survived to this point" Meta Narrative that by taking control of this PC, we have become a [Deus_Ex_Machina](Writing/Deus_Ex_Machina.md). We only survived because we're the player, we're meant to survive, and we have the gamer skills to help this avatar survive when they otherwise wouldn't have.

If you view the game as being a single universe, and not the journey across universes and the unique alternate realities (special universes) acquiring power levels, then it's completely missable.

The first time through, "The Hunter" is a cartoonishly tropey video game villain. He's obviously evil. How callous can you be to all the human lives in the universe? We matter! This guy is nuts.

But something happens as you push toward that black Starborn spacesuit: by the time you are on your 7th iteration of Sam and Andreija, you start to become The Hunter. Their lives matter less and less to you. You lose interest in doing any of the companion or romance quests. You just want to collect the artifacts, hit the temples, and dip out to start the next level. You figure out that you can basically do the whole Constellation NG+ quest in like 2 visits to The Lodge...and no matter what you do to anyone in this universe, it all gets erased when you hit The Unity.
