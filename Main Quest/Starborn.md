You know what would’ve been a great Starborn power? Teleporting.
Would straight fix many complaints about going through loading screens back and forth between quest giver and quest objective. Just plonk down the mark at the giver, complete the quests and then TP back. Sure the NPC wouldn’t acknowledge this magical feat that occurs right in front of them. But they don’t do that already, so nothing much has changed there.

Starborn ships start [landing](Random%20Encounters.md) after a certain point in the MQ and act identical to Pirate or Ecliptic ships, dropping off a small battalion of NPCs to meander around the landscape for some reason. I thought Starborn worked alone, odd that some would try to find each other, only to then fly to random planets and walk about on patrol. Maybe hoping across universes got boring.

You enter the universes you find at the first place where you jumped after having touched an artifact. This seems to imply that, while the nature of the multiverse may be infinite, you are limited to a degree by which you can explore that infinitude to 'merely' the infinite variations possible within the reality you started from (hence why you're stuck in the game's scenario - that's your only option despite its infinite possibilities of procgen planets). 

This is why [The Hunter](The%20Hunter.md) and [The Emissary](The%20Emissary.md) are always who they are, and why events play out as they do all the time. The hunter is aware of this, and his dialogue even mentions that despite all the possibilities, certain things where he is involved always seem to be necessary to progress through the cycle of reaching Unity again.

They’re meant to be intimidating and mysterious, a group of dimension hoppers with advanced tech, ships, suits, and literal superpowers. Everyone talks up how alien they are and that continuing to search for the [Artifacts](Artifacts.md) would be dangerous given these Starborn are hunting for them too.

Except the only one who becomes an actual threat is [The Hunter](The%20Hunter.md), purportedly the strongest one of them all since he’s implied to have gone through the [Unity](Unity.md) hundreds if not thousands of times. 

Every other Starborn? They don’t gather a single artifact and constantly get themselves killed attacking an explorer group whose specialty isn’t even combat.

How are dimension hopping, ageless superhumans so damn incompetent? They made it through the Unity once but can’t defeat a rich guy’s explorer club? Hell, if the Hunter is any indication then the majority of the time the only casualty in his jaunts is the Player. Who, if your alternate universe self is any indication, really was just a Space Miner who got suckered into what they assumed to be a grand adventure.
	Don’t forget, you are a starborn the second you walk into Unity. So we’re literally talking about a group of people who got lucky at least once, maybe only ever once…. Then tried to Karen the rest of the universe from doing it.

Every Starborn we meet should be on par with the difficulty of the Ebony Knight.

We sorta get that when we storm the final base for the final artifact. I still don't know why they all gang up at that last location. Are they teamed up with [The Emissary](The%20Emissary.md)? Should be a free for all if they're just there to poach the [Artifacts](Artifacts.md).

Throughout the game, the ships that land everywhere are always carrying a small landing party of super easy minions and the ships in orbit that always attack us are dead in seconds. It's as if every Starborn are first timers. I'd love to run into more Starborn that have specific names that are at my level or above. A random encounter with a Starborn double my level would give me some real incentive to run away or be genuinely afraid.

"Morrowind is a story that you can opt into. And that’s never changed about Elder Scrolls. You can leave the main quest behind and never finish it. "But where I think Morrowind is probably the most successful is that it’s the best novel about a character you never meet. And that would be Nerevar, the guy that you’re supposedly the reincarnation of. Everything orbits around that character. Even if you’re not on the main quest, he was such a vital part of the earliest history of that nation. The world couldn’t exist, and the cultures wouldn’t be the same, without that inciting incident. So that helps make it feel real." - Michael Kirkbride
	Emil tried this with the Starborn, but doesn't have the will to really push it.

In regards to Kirkbride creativity: "He was absolutely essential. And also crazy as a rat in a drainpipe, which is necessary. Somebody had to be really, really, really crazy, and it’s better that your lead designer isn’t." - Ken Rolston
"I might’ve been the narrative lead, but Michael was the luminary — the man with spectacularly exotic and bad judgment that excited us so much."- Ken Rolston
	They had a narrative lead, and a crazed dreamer for a narrative creator. They're right that they need someone down to earth to be the game designer, Emil fits there, but why do they still give him so mcuh creative control over the world - clearly that isn't his forte. His is too limited and safe playing.
