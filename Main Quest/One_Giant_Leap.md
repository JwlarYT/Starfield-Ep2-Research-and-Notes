The final “slideshow” of seeing your effects on the universe was disappointing. 

Only the largest quest chains and factions will be visible. I did quite a few more minor quests, but I got nothing from them. I’d have liked some more F: NV style ones for a “neutral” ending of them, where the player didn’t intervene. What happens if the player never joins [Vanguard](•UC%20Vanguard%20Mission%20List.md)? 
They may have been worried about spoiling those questlines for people who rushed the MQ, but if they were willing to do that, then I would see this as more of a perfect way to tease quest lines to players for missing them. 
Like a little VO speaking about how Terromorphs overran [New_Atlantis](New_Atlantis.md) would have been great to wet their appetites and make them think: "Damn! I’ve gotta check out that faction in the next universe, that sounds sick!"

Instead, I was left with the two interactions related to the MQ. The companions could have done with much more closure, in my opinion, even if the player didn’t complete their quests. Again, like in FNV.

All [Companions](Companions.md) push you to eventually go through the [Unity](Unity.md) even though they chickened out too.
They do admit to their hypocrisy, though. 
	Emil is too scared to commit to the player having to make a hard choice. 
	What if some of them DID go through? The player would then have even more reason to push through to the Unity, seeing as that’s clearly what they *want* players to do. 
		This could result in some excellent dynamics to push the character development of the [Companions](Companions.md). 
		How would Sam react if Cora went through, but he didn’t? How distraught would he be, begging the player to return to [Unity](Unity.md), possibly even becoming hostile or leaving as a companion if we refuse? 
		Perhaps Sarah regrets her decision and falls into a depression unless we go back to the [Unity](Unity.md), etc.
