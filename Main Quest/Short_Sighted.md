Short Sighted seems to exist to twist the knife more when the starborn invade the Lodge. Making going to the Eye feel safe, as well as place the story of the satellite failing.

Repairs are made through a pop-up message Daggerfall style - old school CRPG method. This feels like a shortcut made to save time, but other than a short cutscene - which would take a lot of art and animation time for such a minor piece of content - I can’t see how better to do this. Perhaps a fade to black like in KCD2? At least that would allow some minor change in the scene. It feels a bit rushed for a first-person immersive game, but it’s understandable from the perspective of releasing a finished game versus one that's still in development.
 “Short Sighted? Yeah it sure is!”
	Maybe something to do with Will Shen having to rewrite the Main Quest 3-4 times

Story not well planned.
Will Shen multiple rewrites etc (which can be heard in VO differences due to Covid).
Missions like Short Sighted highlight this the most, such a filler quest just to set up the Hunter battle.
