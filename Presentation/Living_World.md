Parts of Starfield do not exist without you. What I mean by that is that if you’re too early for certain [Side_Quests](Side%20Quests/Side_Quests.md), the NPCs involved are simply not alive. 
In New Vegas, while the NPCs are incredibly static, they have lives before the player is tasked with interacting with them in some quests. 
	You can talk to them before they are ‘needed’ by a writer. 
This isn’t the case in Starfield. A smuggler used by Yannick (Neshar’s employer) is hiding out in Warehouse 1 in [Ebbside](Cities/Ebbside.md), accosted by the Syndicate gang. This smuggler can never be found before he is used. Warehouse 1 is completely empty if you come too early. 
	Why can't we meet him before Yannick is trying to get rid of him? Interact with him somehow, even if it is just to have him tell us to ‘F off’. At least prove that he’s a living person in your world and not a plot device. 
Again, this is a game built around [NG+](Gameplay%20Systems/NG+.md), so much more could be done here. A [Starborn](Main%20Quest/Starborn.md) player could visit the smuggler before Yannick wants to disappear him, maybe appeal to him, try and get him to change his ways - anything to recognise that we have come from another universe…

Evan was right, missed opportunities describes Starfield to the T.

+ ^This is true for Quest items too. A quick task for Enhance! in [New_Atlantis](Cities/New_Atlantis.md) has us finding a lost data slate for the receptionist, who in a reference to politicians losing essential information by leaving it in public places, has lost the data of all recent Enhance! patients by negligence. 
+ We find the slate directly above the cosmetic surgery in a luxury cocktail bar. Said item will NOT spawn until we start the quest. Not to mention that this quest is missing a few options for Role-playing. Like holding the slate for ransom. 

Oblivion even had items that would be static and could be grabbed before quests. (Great Welkynd Stone in Miscarand)

[Xenofresh](Cities/Neon_City.md) job application conveniently opens up now that it is required for the Yannick quest. It would’ve been nice to have this be its own quest that could intersect with Yannicks. When he asks about joining Xenofresh, we could then interject that we are already an employee etc.

Trespass zones missing. (Maybe because of time constraints) no trespass zones in ship interiors, urban areas, shops and people's houses.
	 does exist in the game but only for quests bizarrely. A case where Todd's love of systems designing the gameplay has been sidelined. 
		 For example in the Seokugh Syndicate Hideout and other Ryujin quests. You get a notification when you are trespassing. It would be good to have that more casually throughout the game.
	 
Its unrealistic that you can just walk anywhere without consequences. While you are at it, make NPCs react to you brandishing weapons in civilian areas (or pointing guns etc.. Missing reactivity of previous games 
	Need to test
