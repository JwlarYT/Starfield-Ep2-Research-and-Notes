[[World Building]]

Starfieldâ€™s world is missing believable living background music - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzak

I don't really mind not having the radio like Fallout, I've played probably 50+ hours and haven't really felt like I've 'missed' it. But there could be other ways to make it work within their vision.

A cool middle-ground would be music stores/radio stations in cities, where you could buy music to make a playlist in your ship, or tune into the local system's bandwidths when you're on a faction-claimed planet.

Akila could have country/blues style music, Neon could have Synth/punk/rock, New Atlantis could have classical and pop and so on. Then outposts could have a random mix of whatever the settlers wanted to take on their expeditions, or be a pirate radio station as a random structure on a planet.

I wish I hadn't started typing, now I want a system like that.
