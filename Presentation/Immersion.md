The game is far more immersive when not played on stream. I cranked up my headphones, reclined my chair and even used a controller and I can say it was a much more favourable experience, and did fulfil a bit of that Bethesda immersion I had been missing. My gripes with world design still remain, but they were better masked by Zur’s soundtrack and very good [Sound Design](Sound%20Design.md) as you walk the city. Chatter, the sounds of flags waving as you pass by them, space traffic overhead, birds in the sky and trees. The city felt really alive, helped even more so by the largest crowd we have seen in a Beth game so far.

Walking around the [New_Atlantis](New_Atlantis.md) at night really highlights the beauty in the new lighting systems. The city looks beautiful against the twilight sky. I’m excited to reach Neon now, which should be even more striking.

The sunrises in this game are stunning. I’m not one to usually use photo modes in games, but there are some times when this game really benefits from having one.

#### Ambient Dialogue

There are conversations in the main areas to give some life, between gardeners, etc., so it’s not all dead air. It’s mostly the unnamed crowd members associated with the corresponding graphical settings who are to blame for the literal window dressing, which, in my opinion, harms the sense of life in the cities. 
	Although these lot do still chatter from time to time, so in this regard I do feel I’m being somewhat too critical here. I wish they didn’t stare at the player so disconcertingly, but then again, had a stranger just walked up on my group so nonchalantly, we’d probably look at them too. At least we’d say 'hi' and ask who they are, though lol.

Still amusing that Outland in New Atlantis is so empty when a couple outside raves about how good the stuff is, and then it sells eight relatively weak spacesuits, yet has none on display. (And nowhere where stock could realistically exist). Still not fixed since the launch day live stream, except for a singular suit added as a Creation that is offered for free.
	Named NPCs repeat conversation with each other, so the player can't miss any content. (Happened in Newell’s Goods in Neon)—a delicate balance to strike. You don't want the player to miss this dialogue, but also don't want them to be spammed with it. 
		I must conclude that I would prefer the chance to miss it, especially since [NG+](NG+.md) is intrinsically tied to the [Main Quest](•Main_Quest.md); it isn't as if we won't have another opportunity to hear it again.

A common problem in ships is that companions/crews over-talking the player chatting with other nearby ships, even during crucial story moments, killing the tone and urgency.
I’m very interested in your relationship issues, Andreja. Still, maybe you and Sarah can give it a rest while I’m discussing battle-plans with the [Starborn](Starborn.md) - you know, the very inter-dimensional human demigods you should be enthralled with at [Constellation](Constellation.md)?
