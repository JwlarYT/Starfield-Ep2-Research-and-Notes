The problem isn’t using the systems, it’s overusing them.

Random POIs may have started as far back as Oblvion, but they went under the radar for most / didn’t hinder the game at large too much. Having EVERY [Points_of_Interest](../Exploring/Points_of_Interest.md) be random is too much. Players see the smoke and mirrors. We know games are an illusion, but we don’t want to be reminded of it.

Mention how I’m using old games to compare only because Starfield wants to stick to that style. I would support a game that distanced itself from that “Bethesda” style, that tried to do something new with those tools. Mention Star Wars Genesis Coruscant for how a sci-fi city doesn’t need the player to be able to go everywhere. That’s how KOTOR et Al approach it. 
It will be a departure from the BGS style, but I don’t think that style works in a Sci-fi world. It forces certain choices. Like the destruction of Earth and near extinction of humans.
