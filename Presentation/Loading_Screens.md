Camera Mode photos sometimes appear as a loading screen. Loading screens that use pictures are rare, though (only seen when loading a save in my experience), as most are just a black screen that lasts 1-3 seconds.

Kill immersion. A tunnel walk in an another game (say SW: Jedi Survivor) or an elevator in Fallout 4, the games maintain their illusion and immersion into a fantastical world. A loading screen reminds you that it’s a game, for people who use open world RPGs as a means to escape from reality, this is bad.
- that and the number of screens, like going for 2 every time you want to visit a shop irks people over time 
- A game that is a death by one thousand cuts.

Other loading sections make no sense. The massive open section of [Cydonia](Cities/Cydonia.md) could load seamlessly, but now a small entrance room of the [Nova Galactic](Main%20Quest/The_Old_Neighborhood.md) space station needs another cell? I understand that this is entering the “dungeon”, but why not have this transition as we boarded, not 6 metres after?

There's a difference between a single loading screen to leave a dungeon to go to the outer world and having to go through almost 10 loading screens to go to a different planet.
	The game philosophy just doesn't match well with BGS's design and development practices.

The entire point of a [space exploration](Exploring/Travelling.md) game is to use your ship to fly from planet to planet. If we're just skipping all of that, then just remove the ships entirely and give me a teleporter.

Immersion and role playing are central to BGS games, so in my opinion, my two choices shouldn't be to either skip the role-playing aspect of space flight or deal with tons of loading screens. It's just bad design philosophy.

Many games use loading screens, but the content lying on the other side of those pauses from the gameplay was worth waiting for. Mass Effect is littered with annoyingly long elevator rides and loading screens, but the core story, character interactions and dialogue made those games something people continue to play decades later despite those loading screens. It's why I don't have a problem with the loading screen being used to transition to a large area, like opening a dungeon, or The Well. It's only irksome when the content seemingly isn't worth the pull out of the immersion, like a tiny shop.
