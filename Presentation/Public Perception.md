Starfield does not create memes; it feeds into them, like with the warranty insurance ship. A comedic way to waste up to 200k credits, as there is no in-game way of actually contacting the warranty company for a claim.

Biggest meme is people posting in the subreddit "This game is so pretty sometimes!" and it's just 15% barren planet and 85% skybox."

It is both inconsistently good, and inconsistently bad, which is precisely why I think it is so evenly divisive. This also goes in line with Greg Miller describing it as the biggest "your mileage will vary" game of his career, and this is a guy who's been reviewing games for the past 20 years I believe. 
The game is greatly inconsistent which is probably a direct result of the "too many hands in the pot" problem that Will Shen talked about. [Interviews](Interviews.md)

Sometimes, the game looks genuinely stunning. Other times, it can look pretty bad. Sometimes, the character models look great as well, other times you got the crowd citizens which looks less than stellar. Sometimes, [•Exploring](•Exploring.md) just works and it clicks because maybe you've been doing just little enough of it that you've only ever discovered unique locations and cool [Random_Encounters](Random_Encounters.md). Other times, you keep finding the same copy-pasted [Points_of_Interest](Points_of_Interest.md) right off the bat.

The persuasion mini-game is sometimes genuinely great when you get the ones with unique dialog options. Other times, you encounter the instances which all use the exact same generic lines like "I know you would help me if you could". Sometimes, there are some really cool [Consequences](Consequences.md) and follow ups to your actions and [Side Quests](Side%20Quests.md) but sometimes there are none.

Some of the quests and questlines are genuinely great content, some of them are scraping the bottom of the barrel. Some of the interiors are seamless, but some are locked behind loading screens.

Sometimes, the game wants to show you [Hard Sci Fi](Hard%20Sci%20Fi.md) nasapunk. Other times, it wants to show you sleek fantasy sci-fi or [cyberpunk](Neon_City.md). 

This is the actual reason why opinions on the game are so greatly divided. Some people are having a great time with the moments in which the game is great, while others are having a bad time with the moments in which the game is bad.

Would show that BGS successfully made a game for the upper management (who fall into this age range).
