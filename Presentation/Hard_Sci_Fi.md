Regarding sci fi - sure, if your point is about the "lost potential of exploring specifically sci-fi themes", then after thinking about it, Starfield really doesn't involve sci-fi too much.

The MSQ was more about magic than sci-fi.
CF were just pirates.
FC was just exploitation or something.
UC was the best example with xenowarfare stuff.

Like I can see the interest to having sci-fi be just a boring background flavor and all your problems are just human problems. I'd say Star Wars is like that. There's tech, sure, but it's just essentially humans doing human things while using advanced tools.
