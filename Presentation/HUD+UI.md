### UI

Ui is made for controllers. Text is too big and the default wheel menu feels slow and cumbersome on PC. Better to use direct inventory/map/character hotkeys.

The UI looks to be designed by multiple people and forced together. The mission screen, map screen and status screen have handy back buttons in the top left (like a web browser), but all the other screens available from the master ‘wheel menu’ do not - inventory, ship and skills.

If you accidentally open the map, you have to tab back three times to get back to the master menu, or hold tab to close it, which closes the entire menu. Quite frustrating. Especially as you cannot move to the other menus using hotkeys - ie. if you open the map, and then want to go to the inventory, using the I key no longer works. You have to tab back 3 times, or hold tab and then open the inventory when the game screen is back.

Can't select sell/buy with mouse in vendor menu. General lack of care for PC user in UI design.

### HUD

HUD seems fine. It is pure white though, so it can get a bit lost on bright backgrounds, like New Atlantis. 

The left hand corner is occupied by your smartwatch, which mostly acts as you stamina meter.

The stamina system had been reworked. Instead of a fatigue bar that slowly decreases until empty, and then refills once sprinting/jumping/attacking has ceased, the “oxygen” meter (white) can continue to drop below 0, and instead fill with CO2 (red). 

This stops the player from spamming tiring actions in battle or when traversing the landscape (sprinting/jumping) as they can damage themselves by not monitoring their CO2 levels. The screen will flash red to indicate when your CO2 levels are high, so at least it is hard to miss this.

When your scanner is activated, the smartwatch switches to tracking information about the local environment, showing the player the temperature, oxygen percentage and gravity.

The player can be afflicted by a number of [Ailments](../Gameplay_Systems/Ailments.md) that require specific medications or a doctor's visit to fix. Such as hyper and hypothermia, concussions etc.

The scanner will show destinations for you to walk towards (like how the compass worked in FO and TES) but some places are not on it. These are still worth [•Exploring](Exploring/•Exploring.md), and in my experience so far, they are large enough vocal points that you can not miss them. ( I found two huge abandoned Helium mining towers on the moon that netted me some nice resources ).
