There are good sequels that would be highly rated if they were stand-alone, but are maligned by the fact that they followed greatness.

Yes, had an indie studio made Starfield, it would be loved and seen as a technical achievement, but an indie company didn’t make it. A company that stands among industry-leading giants did.

TES does gameplay [[Role-Playing]] better. Until recently, Fallout did [[Dialogue]] RP better. Starfield can’t avoid being compared to its brothers, and unfortunately for it, despite being mum and dad's favourite, they aren’t all that.

Remember, though: “Comparison is the thief of joy”
It’s okay to like Starfield; it’s okay to be easy to please - that isn’t an insult. It’s a character trait; to be optimistic isn’t a sin. Being in a state of mind where the glass is half full is a blissful state to find oneself in.
