Wildlife fits the planet aesthetics - are they generated too? (Need to verify) - the names are. They follow the prefix [planet name] [alien type]. Ie. Kreet Grazer, Kreet Pradator etc. 

Not all galaxies are accurate to their real life counterparts. Alpha Centauri, the Solar System where [New_Atlantis](New_Atlantis.md) is situated, should have 3 stars in reality, but only has one in game. This is a design choice and not a limitation, as other galaxies on the star map clearly have 2 stars.

The algorithm is even broken in places, I found a wetlands area with borked water. Still, though, from certain angles, you can get some breathtaking views, and at times, the illusion is strong enough to sell itself as an interesting place to be… if only that facade didn’t fall away so quickly.

Sun lighting can be very cinematic at times in a JJ Abrams crazy lens flare kind of way.
Planet lighting is really cool I will admit. This moon I'm on was dark until its parent Gas Giant came over the horizon, reflecting the sun and supplying some low-level light. I can also see a shadow of another moon on the Gas Giant! Although I’m unsure where the light source casting this shadow is meant to be coming from.

The three dots over a planet on the starmap indicate a settlement - these are predominantly random [POI](Points_of_Interest.md) locations, such as Mining Outpost and Science Outpost. A means of acquiring the radiant quests and a decent landing spot to start surveying, if that’s your thing. I would have preferred if they were named like in Daggerfall - it helps give them a little life. Humans prefer to live in a location, not an unnamed outpost - consider the places scientists reside in the Arctic. Some of them are literal, but not all.

Some of the aliens are fascinating, such as the camouflaged giant leaf bugs and the small acorn worms. They are all very grounded in what could be found on earth but at huge scales. Realistic to a fault imo. Alien life could be… anything? Why try to root it to something so mundane?

#### Earth
I visited the London memorial, it is the tip of the Shard. Why this is the only surviving building in the entire city is anyone's guess. The ground level seems to have raised around 100m too.

**Technically a post-apocalyptic earth.**
Earth was destroyed by its magnetic fields collapsing, removing our atmosphere (as shown by the planet having 0% oxygen) and our protection from the solar winds. Like with Mars, Earth has been stripped clean of all life, although I don’t think only a few measly buildings would be left standing, but instead more FO style ruins. 

Given the scale of the game, this was a necessary sacrifice I guess, there was no way Beth were going to make a [Procedural_Generation](Procedural_Generation.md) algo to create 100s of ruined cities, but still, it does harm the impact of returning to Earth. It is mostly rock as far as the eye can see, and what monuments you can visit (after being told about them by passing NPCs) don’t leave much of an impact because of how isolated they are.

The only reason to visit this monument, past curiosity - and to tick them off of your activities - is to collect the snow globe conveniently left at each one. A nice collectible reference to this most Earthly of cheesy decorations (and possibly another reference to NV).

The geographical data is wrong, which is a bit disappointing, as I’m sure height maps of Earth have been made before (just look at Microsoft Flight Sim). I’m not asking for 1 to 1, but you would expect the Himalayas to be mountainous for example - not just the same hilly desert as London.
	Especially as BGS used data supplied by Nasa to help make the game more scientifically accurate

In reality, there was no way of winning here, they would've been better off destroying Earth [Alderann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs1xNRXROfA) style to prevent moaners like me lol

#### Fauna

Creature designs are reminiscent of dinosaurs at times. It has a Star Wars feel to it. 
I cannot tell if they a proc gen’d. Seeing as ‘only’ 100 of the planets have life, it is possible that they are all hand made.
	They are hand-made - concept art can be seen in the [Starfield_Direct](Starfield_Direct.md)

They look quite alien, even not a bit unispired timid herbivore on this planet looks like a horrendous living mushroom that has bug-like mandibles and tiny useless chicken wings sprouting out of its back. Very alien, and a welcome respite from the other creatures that appear closer to slight variations of dinosaurs.
	Perhaps even insipid would be the right term

The naming conventions use suffix and prefix around a creature 'type'. The brontosaurus is called a Herding Bonemane Grazer. Herding and Grazer are descriptive terms for the creature's behaviour (linked to a few various AI packages), with Bonemane being its actual name
