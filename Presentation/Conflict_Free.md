I'm not against the conflict free world of Starfield.
While in my head, [Starfield 0](Writing/History.md) is more exciting, that opinion has forced me to introspect. Do I need all of my game worlds to have some degree of high-stakes conflict? Am I so basic that I will only subscribe to the ABCs of world design?

I view Morrowind as a proof of concept for a conflict-free world. Like Starfield, it presents a tension stemming from past conflicts, including the Imperial colonisation of Vvardenfell, the political tension between the houses, and, of course, the literal threat of full-scale war with Dagoth Ur. I realise that it is not the elements present that Starfield that is missing, but the utilisation of them.

There is the past conflict between the [United_Colonies](Factions/United_Colonies.md) and [Freestar_Collective](Factions/Freestar_Collective.md), political tension between their governmental ideologies, and the threat of human destruction from the Terromorphs. The problem isn't that they don't exist; it's that they don't truly interact or intertwine. 

Look at the Terromorphs, other than the Freestar Collective helping with their eradication after you choose the Aceles option, they aren't involved. This is a human destruction level threat; they should've forced their way onto the negotiating table somehow. The idea that they would flop over and concede to the UC Technocracy authoritarian decision when that is the exact political style that sought independence from is imperceivable.

Or how the two factions barely interact past lore dialogue and a few side quests. It's why the Groundpounder mission stands out as a rare example. It does fall into the trope of them fighting together and realising they aren't so different after all, yet not only does that fit the theme of the game (that humans are still humans), but it also allows choices where the player can be patriotic and take out whatever side they're character disagrees with.

Worse still is that there are elements of Emil's misinterpreted "write what you know" at play, but he doesn't know what to do with it. 
The UC is USA coded, not a complete replicate, but there are elements. As well as the world being in a state of relative peace, that's all Emil knows. The US HAS stayed in an almost consistent war of some kind, but nothing to the degree of Vietnam or WW2. And there's the spy network. This is what feels like a huge missed opportunity. 

The UC has a massive espionage and information-gathering contingent, constantly keeping an eye on the Freestar. You'd think the feeling is neutral, but when you learn more about the Freestar Collective from the rangers, they're so laid back about it, they don't care for spying on the UC, and while they resent them for the colony war, they aren't paranoid. 

This one-sided paranoia could've been used so well to parallel something like the Iraq war; the elements are all there. Where the UC could be so on edge that they start reading way too much into otherwise banal Freestar info, eventually launching some spec ops missions against them to prevent what they believe to be the creation of Xenoweapons or something similar, only to discover how wrong they were. 

This would've been an excellent angle to pivot the UC Vanguard quest line, as again, the elements are there. You're pulled into the propaganda with the museum, already learn that the UC is shady with the locked up General, and then suddenly you're the operative who has committed a war crime on false information. 
It could be like Spec Ops: The Line, and really force the player to look inward on their actions and how far they will go for false patriotism. 

Especially if they then went the Edward Norton route, where you're declared an enemy of the UC as they try to save face, and you have the opportunity to expose them through an SSNN interview, or going to the Freestar Collective for asylum.
It fits the theme of humans still being human, and uses the elements that ALREADY exist within the world from Emil applying what he knows. He just doesn't push it far enough.

This doesn't have to scale up to full conflict either, ideally it would have a more hopeful conclusion of the UC pulling away its spy network, exposing the general and having closer ties to the Freestar Collective. Remembering that Hope is another key theme, and the tone of the game overall.
