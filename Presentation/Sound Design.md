Chatter, the sounds of flags waving as you pass by them, space traffic overhead, birds in the sky and trees. The city felt really alive.

Inon Zur’s soundtrack is what holds the landscape exploration together, combined with the sfx. The distant rumble of space as moon rocks shatter and fall below you feet meld beautifully with Zur’s ambient tunes. Lots of strings and a welcome addition of some ethereal synths have really helped me to stay immersed. More importantly, it has helped me enjoy what is otherwise mundane running between locations.

#### Voice Acting

Some of the audio mixing is a bit off. Theresa Mason’s voice lines in the SNN questline alter from secretive to loud and happy quite abruptly. 

I have heard my first bout of ‘bad’ voice acting from a receptionist on [[Gargarin]] (in the Alpha Centauri system). His name is Bonifac, and he sounds like he is reeling off the terms and conditions at the end of an advertisement rather than cracking jokes about the local tavern (which is what he was doing in the entirely wrong tone). This is an outlier case to be fair, most voice work is adequate or good so far.

Audio editing on Sophie Jex is awful, like mod level bad. (Aurora line) - worse than mine! But I'm an amateur Youtuber, not a multi-billion dollar corp.
First instance of dodgy voice acting - really sounds like it’s the first time the character is reading the script. Odd pauses and emphasis on random words with little rhyme or reason.
Almost sounds like the original was saying how Aurora ‘isn’t’ legal, but they realised the mistake too late and tried to fix it in post.
[[Dialogue]] - Cannabis reference line with “I have a medical license”. Which Sarah dislikes. Feels out of place for the game, odd commentary or just a throw-away joke?
