- We assume that games are best balanced around the default mode, but that isn't always the case.
- For example, if a game has complex consumables and systems that improve combat, but the combat is so trivial that you never have to interact with them, then the default difficulty is actively harming the player's interaction with those tactics.
- Often, playing a game on a harder difficulty can feel like a whole new experience, even more so when additions like a survival mode add mechanics that we're originally missing. Fallout New Vegas and 4 are both great examples that, in my opinion, benefit from this additional difficulty. 
- But it's a difficult tightrope to cross, Skyim's Legendary difficulty, for example, goes too far into the realm of tedium, where hacking at enemies becomes a chore, even when utilising all of the extraneous features, from smiting, enchanting and poisons to try and level the playing field.
- There's also the average player to consider. A higher difficulty level may improve player feedback in the long run, where they feel accomplished for mastering a difficult combat scenario after throwing every bit of knowledge they had into the fray. Yet if the opening few hours where said knowledge is at a minimum are too difficult, they're likely to change the difficult to something more manageable and miss out on that future triumph.
- Even when said harder difficulty, with said late game advantages, is as hard as the settings may imply. The Very Hard mode that Starfield shipped with followed exactly what many dislike about BGS's past systems, and felt like they had learnt nothing from the overall praise they received from the addition of Fallout 4's survival mode, made even stranger by Starfield's inclusion of multiple hardcore survival mechanics inspired directly from Todd's favourite space faring table top RPG.

- This later update, then, is the answer that should've been there at launch. It's easy to critique BGS for taking their time in adding these features. When many comparisons are made by others towards Cyberpunk 2077 or No Man's Sky, even by myself, it's only fair that, from this point on, we ignore this. A complete critique of a game that is, for lack of a better term, still in development is quite the task - how can it be complete when the game still isn't? 
- So yes, Starfield released without crucial components, but from here on out, I will focus on analysing the Starfield that currently exists as of the creation of this video. And when an eventual Part 3 releases, that too will evaluate the game as it exists at that future time.
- The importance of difficulty options cannot be understated, and that's more true since this update than ever before in a BGS title. If the wrong one is chosen, it can alter our experience with a game from one we could've adored into one that struggles to excite. And it all starts before any gameplay has even begun.
- It's hard enough trying to guess how good you may be at a given genre based on some faraway developer's notion, not to mention how every game is balanced to different standards. Very Hard in Starfield was not the same as Elden Ring, which is why the ability to tweak the game to an impressive degree is a huge bonus.
- The only problem with these settings, which is a problem with such settings as a whole, and not just Starfield's implementation, is that they require the player to know about the gameplay they are altering. 
- When playing a game for the first time, we have no idea what any of these settings are adjusting, or what that adjustment may entail.
- Any spike or dip in the difficulty of each setting can misinform the choice long-term, resulting in even more time spent in a menu tweaking it to a personal ideal. If you get it wrong and the next hour of gameplay is far too challenging, you have to move the scales back down, which is disheartening. 
- Fine-tuning this menu throughout a playthrough may not bother some, but for others, it's probably something they aren't interested in. They aren't the designers until they've invested a large number of hours into the game; they likely do not have a strong enough grasp to understand what may be best for their specific taste. It's easier to instead trust that the developers have balanced the experience to best fit the wider audience, and in Starfield's case, I don't think that's true.
- Furthermore, there's the risk of undermining intended moments if this mentality of altering the difficulty becomes second nature. Where certain battles or environmental obstacles are designed to greatly increase the toughness for a gameplay or story effect. Or how they the settings may be abused to benefit in some way, either curtailing boss fights, or speed-running the levelling process.
- Yet, while this is true, one has to remember that BGS games are in large single-player experiences, and that the player is giving this responsibility under the belief that they have the freedom to harm what the developers may have intended if that is their main wish. 
- Which is where I agree with Raycevik that bluntly, there is no perfect solution. For a new player, Starfield's additional gameplay options won't improve their initial impressions, but will help them perfect the game to how they would like to play it if they do find themselves enjoying it. Which is to say, that for the limited fans of Starfield, this was a great update, but on its own, it's not enough to change the overall opinion.


Difficulty in BGS games has always been borked. Increasing the tedium of the gameplay by scaling enemy HP and damage output exponentially is one of the laziest approaches to this issue.

+ Strat-edgy mentions how difficulty should work along a system similar to Doom.
+ Each successive difficulty option increases the aggression and strength of enemies, while also increasing their numbers.
+ This couldn't be hot-swapped like in the current game and would only come into effect after loading into a new area, but would otherwise be superior.

Starfield already offer a spread of enemy levels in a base. A level 30 Star System, for example, will spawn a POI dungeon with enemies ranging as low as 15, with the boss NPC around 35-40. Higher difficulties should raise the upper threshold and tighten the bottom. Ie, in the same dungeon, low-level enemies are now 25 and the boss is 60.

#### After Update

Carry capacity increase is a bit OP, even on the lowest level of increase; my personal carry capacity is now larger than the default capacity of the Frontier.

The new survival mode is very gimped. You only need to eat every 30 minutes in real time. It’s a simple on/off. You’re either well-fed or malnourished, not in between.

The storage system is turning me into a hypocrite again lol. I generally like having a limited inventory space as it adds an extra level of [Role-Playing](Gameplay%20Systems/Role-Playing.md) where we have to be considerate over what loot we can or cannot carry. This works well in the fantasy medieval world of The Elder Scrolls. But in Starfield, with so much emphasis on resource gathering of raw materials for crafting and outpost building, the heavy weight of said resources makes it a huge chore. The ships have tiny storage too, and if you upgrade it, the resulting space lorry becomes an immovable tank in space combat unless you upgrade everything in tandem (which is intended, in my opinion). 

Shared storage between [outposts](Gameplay%20Systems/Outpost_Management.md) would be a lifesaver for this - it’s possible, but the resource investment needed has the player facing these annoyances until they finally get it set up. By which time they’ll be fed up with the system in its entirety. The new difficulty setting, which gives the player a 1200lb weight limit, is a helpful band-aid, although it completely nullifies the carry-capacity-adding [skills](Gameplay%20Systems/Progression.md) in the process.
