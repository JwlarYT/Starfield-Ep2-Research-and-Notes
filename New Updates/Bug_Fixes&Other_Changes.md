You can now collect resources and loot containers with the scanner open.

We can give books to Cora. A strange omission that we couldn't have done this before. Oversight? Again, [Quality_Assurance](Development/Quality_Assurance.md) playtesting must have been strained or only focused on bugs for this kind of thing to fall through the cracks...

Melee crafting implemented in update

#### Changing Traits after Unity
Changing traits as you change Universes is bugged. The chest in the Sanctum never spawned. This wasn’t initially available, so it's understandable why it wasn’t included before the public outcry.

#### Dialogue Camera
The un-zoomed dialogue camera is greatly appreciated. Makes the NPC seem more realistic, in my opinion, helping to obscure the roughness of some of the animations and making their facial deliveries seem more natural… sometimes, such as when Heller’s eyebrows go crazy when he is rescued.

It’s less jarring in general with the awkwardness of companion dialogue being aimed at an NPC, but delivered to the player. 

This is, unfortunately, met with its own awkwardness as both NPCS and the player lock into position as soon as dialogue starts, leading to convos where one participant may be across the room, and the other uncomfortably close. Why we aren’t free to move around as in Fallout 4, I have no idea. Fair enough, that system had its own quirks, like accidentally drawing your weapon, or walking a little too far away and forcing the convo to end prematurely on accident. Still, I’d say there’s a better fix to those issues than forcing everyone to freeze. Hell, if they aren’t involved in the convo, companions are still free to move, which sometimes leads to being a bit of a distraction, but it proves that movement is at least possible.
