A man is enquiring whether we would like to take part in some sort of test in the [Astral Lounge](Astral%20Lounge.md) that would take us away from gameplay for a moment - he makes this clear with a line that in part feels like a 4th wall break. 

When asked how long the test will take, he replies, “You will not be able to return or speak to your companions until the test is over.” I have no companions with me, how did he know of this? [Immersion](Immersion.md) breaking.

Opening lines of NPCs make it clear that BGS expect us to approach our activities list like a shopping list to be cleared, rather than approach a quest organically. 

This man said, “Would you like to take part in a survey?”. I then became interested, and his first line of dialogue was an almost 1-to-1 repeat of the radiant dialogue. Necessary to refresh a gamer's mind if they’re ticking off the checkboxes in their quest log, but immersion-breaking if trying to approach people organically. 

This is a consistent problem in my experience, with the repetition of radiant dialogue in the first line. It often happens with shopkeepers, especially.

Conflict between area design and quest writing. A doctor who is heading the study in the Astral Lounge is sitting in an open booth - when talking to her, the ambient trance-like club music quiets down, and she communicates in a level one above a whisper. She should have a raised voice at the very least, or be in a private room adjacent to the dance floor, not a table right next to it. 
This whole time, we can still hear the ambient whooping of clientele, but it sounds like it’s next door through a wall, not 6 feet behind us. 
	^WHY isn’t she in one of the VIP rooms? These ARE separate rooms with muffled music, which would make his VO choice make sense.
