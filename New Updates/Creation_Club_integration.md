Scummy tactics by modders to force people to pay for their free mod if they want it to be achievement-friendly. Scalping console users.

Prices are all over the place. A DLC sized mod in Watchtower costs the same as a single BGS made hab.

Gameplay loop well highlighted by youngneil1’s ‘Explorer’ mod. Much of the gameplay focus was placed on resources. Resources are needed for researching, [Crafting](Gameplay%20Systems/Crafting.md), creating ammo, building [outposts](Gameplay%20Systems/Outpost_Management.md) and modding weapons and space suits. Resources are found on planets. It would seem that in an early draft of Starfield, it was much more hardcore, requiring players to interact with Outposts to create a decent resource horde for them to upgrade gear. Hence why weapons modifications cannot be bought. 
However, by selling resources at many stores, it completely nullifies this. His mod severely limits the sale of resources to force players to interact with this gameplay.
	BGS were in a pickle here. They nerfed much of the reasons to build outposts and dive into the crafting systems attached because they were too scared to commit to the hardcore nature, but they also didn’t want to scare off more casual audiences.

Certain mods like the Starfield Compendium are gimped because as of this time mods cannot save/load data, so the compendium can be filled in as players find resources.

No sort of rating system for Creations.

Bethesda basically outsourcing DLC development now.

There was probably a LOT of coordination between Bethesda and Kinggath for Watchtower, the fact Kinggath got an exception to the usual "paid mods release on tuesday" schedule, the fact Bethesda is doing a TON of advertising for it (even putting an ad for it on the main menu) and the fact that Kinggath has also collaborated with Bethesda in an official capacity before (At Hell's Gate) makes me think of it as more like a DLC-lite.
