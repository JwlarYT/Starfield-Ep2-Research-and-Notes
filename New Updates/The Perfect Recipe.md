A free [Creation Club integration](Creation%20Club%20integration.md) from Kris Takahashi, prolific modder of Skyrim and Fallout 4, author of “interesting NPCs” and “Tales from the Commonwealth” respectively. Hired to write ambient dialogue and later quest design for two Creation Club DLCs, the above, and ‘Escape’ (The [Astral Lounge](Astral%20Lounge.md) study).

Perfect recipe quest is terribly designed (but very well written) and can be made much better, this applies to most of the side quests. 
	(elaborate further while watching back recording - **use flowchart to compare to better quest in KCD2, like Whom the Bell Tolls).** 

2 endings, neither are ‘bad’. One has the player save the day even though we do not have the skills to do so, and the other sees Harb (the mission protag) fail but be lifted up by his friends so the failure isn't too bad. It’s a fetch quest that leads to 2 other fetch quests, neither of which can be avoided - even if the player has the materials needed in their inventory.
