Trackers Alliance Creation - Voice line of lady in Cydonia is updated, but not her lip syncing. Good to see that quality control was high for the update.

Bounty Missions for the trackers alliance dont allow the use of the diplomacy skill, a combat skill that pacifies enemies. Doing so prevented me from talking to the target and getting them to come alive (and prerequisites of the quest). You can't even force them to go down them and talk to them then like in the actual quests. Only EM weapons will suffice. To be fair, this is the only time EM weapons have actually been given an actual use.

And after coming back with a EM weapon to do it properly. Of course, the game bugged out and I still had to kill them. At least I didn’t lose the reward after they died.

There's a few [[Starborn]] lines in the mission:
When first approached you can say "I know. You've been trying to find me to invite me to the Trackers HQ. "
When you meet 'Andrastos' you can say "Ok, Hannibal... Oops, I'm mean Adrastos. Let's go."
towards the reveal, "I know, Deke. Hannibal's going to reveal himself and take our ship in 3.. 2... 1..."

Similar to knowing the antagonist in the Rangers faction quests, Ron Hope, there's no 'skip to the end', which whilst not offering total freedom that some players would like, does mean there's actually still quests to play.

[[NG+]] knowledge for the most part consists of some skipped dialogue and lots of "yeah I know what's going to happen here" rather than any different outcomes.

##### The Vulture
Vulture paid quest has a hacked terminal to change how the quest progress and catch him elsewhere. THIS is the kind of alternate quest design I was looking for.
	His ambush is really cool too. 

Not ideal however is how the content isn’t perfectly intertwined with the base game, which is often the case with these creations, even official ones. I found the room that the vulture uses, but I did not require to get a key or check in at the hotel to enter. This can be later excused as the target setting up an ambush, but for RP I would’ve appreciated a line from Dirk in regards to locating the room. Getting the original VA back for a few lines was likely out of the question, so we’re left with what we have.

Final options are kill target, persuade target (failure forces kill), or use lore slates found earlier to empathise with him over Xeno Warfare war crime/colony war PTSD.
Lore items found along the quest can also be used to persuade the target to come quietly. This is level of quest design missing from Starfield, and it’s a damn shame that it’s only in paid DLC that we can see something like this.
Would’ve liked to see some Sarah dialogue to help here, seeing as they are both ware veterans, but again the chances of the VA coming back for a short dlc quest is small. Not the quest designers fault. 

How much of this can be attributed to [[poor planning]]? The poor quest design in the base game, I mean. How much can be blamed on the designers having to work within an alpha build of the game, and not creating their quests on paper? (As per Emil)
This quest, built atop the final game, has us exploring 4 planets, a chance to ambush elsewhere with a satisfying twist to show the target as a threat, and the use of lore from elsewhere in the game (Xenoweapons) as a means of persuading him through items found in-game.
