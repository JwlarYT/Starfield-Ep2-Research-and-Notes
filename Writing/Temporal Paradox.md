A temporal paradox, or time travel paradox, is a paradox, a logical contradiction associated with the idea of time travel or other foreknowledge of the future. 

Such as the Bootstrap paradox
Also known as an information loop is a paradox of time travel that occurs when any event, such as an action, information, an object, or a person, ultimately causes itself, as a consequence of either retrocausality or time travel.
This is used as a narrative device in [[Unearthed]]
