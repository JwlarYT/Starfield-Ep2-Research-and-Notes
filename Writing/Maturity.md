There's a belief among older fans that the people who dislike Starfield aren't mature enough to understand the [Themes](Themes.md)

*"Starfield really does address themes that games rarely do, in honest ways.
Consider the four companions:
- *A 50 something scientist who is stuck in his complicated grief over the loss of his husband 20 years ago. Ervin has been dead far longer than the two of them were married, and yet Barrett can't get over him.
- *A retired soldier who has ptsd and blames herself for the deaths of those under her command. She finds a way to have meaningful work, but she's haunted.
- *A 30 something divorced single father who carries multiple forms of trauma and doesn't have great self-esteem, and seems to have some sort of learning disability.
- *An escapee from a religious cult who hasn't really figured out what she believes and to whom she is loyal.
*And they're not the only place where the game serves us mature themes. The whole message of the Unity is that pressing the reset button comes at great personal cost.
*Generally, everywhere we look in the settled systems, we're confronted with the kind of issues that one has to deal with in real life.
*They're not old enough to get it yet, so they roll their eyes at stuff that tugs the heartstrings of people with more life experience.*"

These elements exist in the game, but they aren't handled with any real maturity.
Any kind of depth whatsoever. Starfield just doesn't deal with the implications of its own ideas and [Themes](Themes.md).
Just having topics that invite mature discussion isn't enough--you have to that discussion on some level as well.
For example, Sarah Morgan's PTSD and survivor's guilt are exposition. It's not a lived-in part of her character, and it's resolved as soon as you comfort her. It's just a box to tick to complete her companion quest line. There's no real growth (or regression), no real character arc.

Starfield does gesture toward themes like grief, purpose, trauma, and faith - but it isn't with much depth. It bewilders me that you would suggest that younger players are put off by games that cover these themes, or games that tug at the heart strings, when games that do all of the above to a much greater depth and with much more care are smash hits. Red Dead 2, Cyberpunk, Baldur's Gate 3, just to name a few. These are heavy games that take their time with emotional storytelling and weighty character development. And for a great many of the folks who play those games, younger and older alike, resonance and enjoyment come *because* of those elements.
