House of Enlightened is a ‘[Religion](Religion.md)’ (more like a charity) based around Atheism and the belief that humanity's empathy for each other is its strongest strength. The name certainly seems ironic, and the leader mentions this, that the name refers to the Age of Enlightenment, when science began to be used to explain the universe and not religion, but it is understandable that the name appears condescending to the religious.

One of the MAJOR talking and selling points for Starfield's setting in the lead up to release, with Emil promising something really thought provoking here.

Instead, they chickened out of addressing "real" religion altogether, deferring to three "new" religions instead. One of which was barely in the base game (Va'ruun), a second of which wasn't even a religion at all and had a single escort quest (Enlightened), and the third (Sanctum Universum) ended up being just literally correct, because the leader (a Starborn) has decided he wants to tell everyone else about the Unity, but for some reason somewhat cryptically, even though he writes books that just spell it all out.
	The most thought provoking here is that Emil was trying to uncover what an religion even is in the modern sense, and came to the accurate conclusion that in some cases, they are a community that does charity work to feel better about themselves.
