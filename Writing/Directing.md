One of a directors most important jobs is to manage and maintain a tone.
In each one of Todd’s games there is a striking and specific tone - Oblvion’s LOTR, Skyrim's Nordic Viking’s and so on. And for all of Todd’s failings, he is good at this part of his job. Starfield’s tone is consistent throughout. And that is what turns off many. Within an hour a player can tell this game has the cassette futurism of Star Wars in aesthetics, but with the cleanliness and themes of classic Star Trek, the language of daytime TV and the quips of… Marvel (heller). Whether you like those or not is more subjective, but if you don’t, oh boy is there no reprieve. The tone is poignant everywhere. The sociopathic fit it, the corrupt government fits it, the corporate espionage fits it. If it irked you within that first hour, there won’t be much to change your mind. 

Yet that problem is in the choice of tone, not its execution. Maintaining that consistent tone is the point, and I have to respect how strong they kept to it. There are no tonal shifts, no whiplash to be had as you go from one section that is comically dark or over the top to something more subdued and subtle. It is harmonious, to a fault.

Desaturated naturalistic look.

Todd know that it's [•Gameplay_Systems](Gameplay%20Systems/•Gameplay_Systems.md) that create many of the memorable moments people love, so that's his focus. 
What happens when you start to remove them, when problems arise, like with Gore ([Interviews](Research/Interviews.md)). They removed them, levitations, recall etc.
But there comes a point where the loss is too much and hurts Todd's goals of answering every question with yes. Especially when these features existed before.
Can you dive? No
Does the water react to explosions? No
Do bodies react realistically to damage? etc etc.
