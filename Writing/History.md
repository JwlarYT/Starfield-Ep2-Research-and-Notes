Teasing us with Mech Graveyard is very sick (in a bad way). Why not let us have mechs Todd 

Needed prequel game - Starfield -1 covering the mech wars between Freestar and UC. 
Then 30 year jump to Starfield with the atrfact plot
Morrowind (and beloved TEs lore) works because it builds upon previous games

Starfield tries to build on nothing tangible

The world of ‘Starfield -1’ blows away Starfield proper. 
The war facilities highlight a far more dynamic game world. 
	This one even has a surface-to-space railgun! How incredible would a quest be where there is a bombardment of ships attacking from space, and the player has to frantically repair and aim the railgun to take them out against a time limit (maybe having the longer it takes result in more NPCs dying and a lower reward). You may have multiple options, such as repairing it with available materials, hacking it back online, or simply finding the necessary parts lying around (for those who aren’t skilled in the other two options).
