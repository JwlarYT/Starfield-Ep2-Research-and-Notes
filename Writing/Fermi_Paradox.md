The Fermi paradox is a conflict between the argument that scale and probability seem to favour intelligent life being common in the universe, and the total lack of evidence of intelligent life having ever arisen anywhere other than on Earth.


Paradox:
A paradox is a logically self-contradictory statement or a statement that runs contrary to one's expectations. It is a statement that, despite apparently valid reasoning from true or apparently true premises, leads to a seemingly self-contradictory or a logically unacceptable conclusion.

A paradox usually involves contradictory yet interrelated elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time.
