A writer who can't write about something they don't know from firsthand experience is not a writer you want on their team. A writer who can't be bothered to research a foreign concept or topic shouldn't be working on a futuristic space odyssey.

He also misinterprets the idea of writing what you know. If you don't know something that you want to write about, you're *supposed to research* that thing so you can write it better. For instance, if you're writing a futuristic space odyssey but aren't an astrophysicist, you can research space travel, read scientific journals, and consult experts to ensure your writing is both accurate and engaging. Which Emil *did*, hence why, for the most part, the NASA sections are competently done. So why not do the same for a group of backstabbing [[crimson fleet|criminals]]? 
It unfortunately feels like he fell back onto his Dark Brotherhood laurels. Family! Loyalty! The night mother! Ok, maybe not that last one, but you can't present your pirates as bloodthirsty individualists and then have them change their tune halfway.
