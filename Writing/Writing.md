Authenticity is everything, and people can tell when something is inauthentic, checking boxes, or avoiding controversy to appease others. Being genuine is essential for making a connection. 

A loose collection of plot holes and anachronisms, badly held together by cut scenes, barren planets and repetitive locations.

Black Isle/Obsidian were interested in creating an RPG where the player creates the story, the writers main focus was creating a framework for that to happen in. Bethesda only tells the story they want to regardless of the players wishes. The ultimately linear aspect of the stories of FO3 and 4 make that pretty clear. The people at Bethesda don't understand what RPGs are, how they work or why they are fun.

My hunch - based on nothing but the blandness which you have observed - is that at a midpoint in the worldbuilding process someone decided to sanitize the whole project. "Thou shalt offend no one" became the prime directive. I think this happened at the midpoint because many of the core worldbuilding elements in the game (a dystopian cyberpunk city, a massive war involving war crimes, fleets of space pirates) are not the sort of things you would want to center the game around if you had started with the premise of a more hopeful take on humanity's future in space. They are, instead, staples of the "gritter" sort of sci-fi story I suspect they began to make before switching to something less controversial.

The UC plot line is a good example of something that doesn't work as shipped, but could have actually been quite good if it hadn't pulled all of its punches. The museum info dump makes me suspect that, at one point, Vae Victis was supposed to have been a dictator who explicitly used xeno-weapons against civilian populations. If that version had made it in, then the Red Devils would have been themselves guilty of warcrimes, and working with them to develop an animal solution to the terrormorphs would have naturally pissed off the Constellation crew, even if the animal solution had substantial benefits over the microbe.

As it stands, Vae Victis is not a dictator, the xeno weapons are just very deadly, your character buys the "we were only following orders" bit from the Red Devils, and you have a muddle of an epilogue where all the Constellation characters are still pissed if you choose the animal, but now have no reason for it.

I don't think the games been unfinished in terms of it storytelling, it's been watered down to the point where it's just bland.
Will Shen had to rewrite the story 3 times, and he clearly feels it's worse for it.

To me, the thing about SF is that it seems like it’s written by old upper-class people who don’t know what struggling is like. Where it falls the absolute flattest is the “gangs” and any sort of criminal activities.
The [Neon_City](Neon_City.md) gang quest is particularly egregious. A gang of what? 5 people led by a middle-aged guy who turned his life around by joining the corrupt police force at the end of the quest? It’s like they had my mom design that quest line.

In trying so hard not to upset any of their audience and appeal to the widest demographic possible, they crafted a generic by-the-numbers narrative that effectively alienates everyone.
Like most fans, I play the games for the world and lore, and acknowledge that the main stories are typically not great, with the side quests usually standing out. It's the gameplay loop that keeps me coming back. If the writing sucks AND the gameplay is lame, then what's stopping people form ditching it for a game that does either of those better, and likely for a fraction of the price.

The use of macguffins and emphasis on unanswered mysteries is reminiscent of JJ Abrams' writing (Lost etc), and all the downfalls and frustrations that that brings.
