Blank and sterile does not appeal to the masses. The biggest miss from the company that will bend over backwards for mass appeal.

200 endings, 16 times the detail, 1000 planets. Todd only speaks quantity while sacrificing the quality.

First new IP in 25 years, and still Starfield is the the least creative and least daring of all of their games in that same time span. Where was the risk taking? You had the chance to blow everyone away, and stuck to ol' reliable instead. Where was the company that tried it all to create Morrowind. [Poor_Planning](Development/Poor_Planning.md) and a development team that was now to large to effectively manage has dragged the game into mediocrity from conception to final execution.

Guns have brands, like Combatech and Kore Kinetics, although nothing is really done with this lore. Helps build up some world believability though.

Starfield aims to evoke a dystopian feel while also maintaining a clean aesthetic, but I don’t think it works well. There’s [The_Well](Cities/The_Well.md) in [New_Atlantis](Cities/New_Atlantis.md) (literally dirty underworld), the drug scene and underlife in [Neon_City](Cities/Neon_City.md), the poverty in [Akila_City](Cities/Akila_City.md). 

I just had some rich guy in a high end restaurant in [New_Atlantis](Cities/New_Atlantis.md) hire to find some coffee that needs to be digested by a dangerous alien (Kopi Luwak reference) because his previous employee died trying to get it. 
When asked about this, he mentions how the risks were in his contract so no one should care. We see more of this Robocop-style evil corpo stuff in the [Paradiso](Locations/Paradiso.md) quest with the rich board members and yet nothing is really done with it. 
	It just kind of exists in this world juxtaposed against the otherwise clean aesthetic, which may be an attempt at commentary on the corruption of money and the state of mankind, but it all feels a little heavy-handed and weak-willed in its delivery. Like they were too scared to commit to actually making any strong comment. 

Employees of some brands like Chunk and Terrabrew even sound like they’ve fallen straight out of The Outer Worlds. Either that game was influenced by these choices, but BGS were too scared to push the aesthetic too far in-case of drawing direct comparisons, or they saw the backlash that game received and backed off from a full commitment. It comes across as gutless and timid, at least Obsidian, for better or for worse, stuck to their gun when designing their corpo-hyper capitalism dystopia.

A significant theme in Starfield is scale, and when considering the Earth in the context of the human race, humanity has managed to flourish beyond the confines of [Earth](Presentation/Planets.md). Losing Earth was horrific, tragic - choose your adjective of choice. We didn't even manage to save any animals (which is its own plot hole for a culture with cloning tech.)
	Yet, an apocalypse on Earth isn't necessarily an apocalypse for humanity. It's not a game about navigating an apocalypse, a la Fallout; that's why the tone is different. The apocalypse is old history, and you're [•Exploring](Exploring/•Exploring.md) the setting that followed it. This is the first time we're seeing BGS deal with a post-post-apocalypse.

The settled systems are facing vast cultural, economic, and educational stagnation following the Great Exodus, the interstellar crusade of House Varuun, and the colony war. Some people don't know that Earth is the human home planet, and most of the population are living in small outposts on barren worlds, or small ass cramped cities. This game is quite post-apocalyptic if you think about it. I think the "hopeful" theme Bethesda was going for is that we are moving forward despite everything else.

Is humanity on its last leg? There are so many derelict stations and abandoned buildings. There are relatively few cities, and only one is nice-looking, but it is a facade. The UC military struggles to keep loosely organised pirates in check and relies on lone volunteers to police the outer systems. Akila is underdeveloped, despite being founded so long ago. And Neon is a drug den that remains well-funded because of said reliance on drug money.

Why no cares about Earth: The people from the settled systems don't really have any attachment to Earth, except for the guys collecting old Earth artifacts I guess. People nowadays don't care about the specific part of Africa where mankind originated before they settled the whole world, why would they be any different.

Dark humour/dystopia implications (and just general commentary on wage slavery) with [Donna Rain](https://starfield.fandom.com/wiki/Donna_Rain)'s minor quest in NA. A girl asks you to get her a coffee because she is tired from working overtime, leading to a conversation about this. The quest is repeatable every few days, highlighting Donna’s optimism in changing her life, but she faces the harsh reality that nothing is changing in her situation. 

On [Neon_City](Cities/Neon_City.md) - Starfield’s idea of a dystopia is when a woman with a business degree who’s forgotten all she learnt cannot find a job and may be cut off from her parent’s cash supply. This is a legitimate encounter on Neon. Perhaps it’s just to highlight the massive discrepancy between the layers of the Rig. In the upper layer this is a citizen's idea of struggling. In Ebbside it may be a victim of gang crime and in the Underbelly even worse? Maybe giving them too much credit here.

Overall theme of the game is hope in the face of adversity. From the MQ, to some of the factions, and even random encounters, humanity will always try to progress and grow. Whether in expanding in space or helping their fellow man. The story between the owner of [Ebbside](Cities/Ebbside.md)'s Euphorika and a Street Rat she helped off the streets embodies that.

Star-system wide communication is possible, a Starstation dungeon in Alpha Centauri has a computer log mentioning that they are capable of phone calling [New_Atlantis](Cities/New_Atlantis.md) , [Wireless_Communication](Presentation/Wireless_Communication.md)

Ship manufacturers' own StarYards are essentially car dealerships that offer ships and unique parts associated with their brand.

Where are chunks made? Small level world design, like in cities is great, but on the larger big picture scale, it’s lacking.
Sunset Sasparilla in NV, Nuka Cola in 3, even the Tomacco in 4, Wine in Oblivion and Eggs in Morrowind. They all have congruent origins. Chunks just… exist? Are they made in house at the franchises? If so, where is the head quarters?

According to lore we ate the Aceles almost to extinction. 
	Not almost; they had to use a genetic engineering program to bring them back to life.
Some lore implications. Both the Kreet lab and Tau Ceti the Morph went after the communications relay. Implying intelligence a bit beyond "angry space spider"

Jemison in Starfield was founded in 2160 along with the capital city New Atlantis, so it’s been 170 years since it was created when you begin play.
It’s the capital city of the UC, the largest human civilization in the Settled Systems.
Where are all the roads?

Not everyone has star ships, hence how limited the space port is. Only the governments, their agents, militaries, corpos etc and a few rich people have them. Hence why Constellation needs a literal ship manufacturer to pay for the Frontier, and why marketing (animations) showed joining a faction as the only way to get a ship.

Question dinosaurs, repeating plants etc - result of colonisation? But palms etc are spread for farming; we see no proof that these are farmed. 
	Devs liked the idea of panspermia, and used this as the basis behind flora and fauna design similarities between star systems.
