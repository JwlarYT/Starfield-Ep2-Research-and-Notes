[[World Building]]

Another interesting choice is the culture. People for the most part have maintained their Earth culture untainted. 

[[New Atlantis]] and [[Akila City]] have a slightly more modern culture, with a strong sense of patriotism to their respective causes (although both tend to adopt American accents for the most part), but [[Neon City]] appears to be the melting pot of the rest of the world… except there’s no melting. After 200 years, the Irish are still Irish, Russians are still Russian etc.

In the cities of Starfield they mingle all the time, and don’t appear to stay in cultural enclaves, so what’s going on here. (Perhaps people only live within their own cultures in outposts, although when we interact with said outposts, this never seems to be the case - but with thousands of them existing, we can pretend that it is)

During the same timeframe, the US has created a real melting pot, with new accents and cultures. 
The people their still refer to their ancestors' heritage and may celebrate at times, but outside of that, to the outside looking in, they are American. 

This hasn’t happened as often in Starfield, and it harms the believability, where inclusion has taken precedence over believability. I don’t doubt that racial differences would still exist, as would that same pride in heritage, but where's the new overarching cultures? 

It’s laziness, really. Creating a new culture that is the melting pot of the entire world is difficult, so why not just have them exist as if it’s still the 2020s and no Earth ending apocalypsese and mass migration occurred…
	^ What’s even weirder is that they DID design a conglomerate culture for the Varuun! With their own unique religion, accent, fashion, armour, ship design, etc.
			The Settled Systems are like a remnant of the immediate aftermath of the Earth evacuation, and for some reason, the Varuun are the only ones to advance as a civilisation. 
				Perhaps because they are more close-knit? Less spread across hundreds, if not thousands, of tiny outposts housing 10–20 people each. (How is inbreeding dealt with in these tiny colonies also?)

[[Akila City|Emil mentioned]] that the Freestar Collective was about "personal freedom and individuality"
	What even is individuality in Starfield? Even the Cyberpunk-inspired Neon is so vanilla when it comes to human appearance. A medical company specialising in cosmetic surgery and facial reconstruction exists, and yet the most outlandish change we see is a possibly trans person using it to change their outward gender appearance in New Atlantis (based on a radiant conversation outside).
		Where are the crazy hairstyles and eye colours? Even skin colours? Just basic humans everywhere, reflecting my critique of the character creator.
			Enhance is called a 'genetics lab', which alludes to gene editing
				Abandoned Biologics Labs point towards experimentation of altering human DNA with alien DNA as well
					A background trait even includes this, literally called Alien DNA - yet it is never explained in-world where this came (except you possibly being a survivor of the above?).
						The system designer behind the backgrounds was clearly working from a premise of a softer sci-fi game.
