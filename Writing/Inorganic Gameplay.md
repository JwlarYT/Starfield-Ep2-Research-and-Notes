How reviewing a game can inevitably alter one's perspective on it. We are playing the game in an inherently inorganic way, even when striving to play organically. For [[NG+]]2, I wanted to explore all of the various [[• Main Quest|MQ]] options to see how much of a difference they make. 

Fans of the game cite this as one of the reasons they believe the game is great, so I wanted to determine whether it’s simply the fact that options exist or if they have a somewhat significant impact. The former is not a good RPG, but the latter is. 

Yet to do just this, I needed to have unlocked all of the [[Progression|social skills ]]and probably will have to save before each quest so I can explore every option, which is unintended gameplay that can harm the experience simply due to its un-[[Immersion|immersive]] nature. Grinding levels to unlock speech aren’t intended either.

There's a pervasive idea that every game must be completed 100% for you to have an opinion on it. If I've played a game for 20 hours and am not enjoying it, I'm putting the game away.
Even if it does get better and becomes a pretty decent experience in the end when you've finished it after 100s of hours, I'd just rather play 3-4 games in that period of time which are shorter, but great from start to finish.
