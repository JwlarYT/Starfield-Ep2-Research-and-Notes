Voice performances are good across the board so far. Although the writing can be a bit wooden and exposition heavy at times, the cast have done their best to deliver the lines sincerely.

The conversation system is not helped by the addition of multiple characters entering a conversation. In Skyrim or FO4 3 or more people could converse and the player could move around (in Skyrim) or the cinematic camera would include all members of the convo (in FO4).

In Starfield, with the more limited locked on front view camera, it can feel a bit jarring when the scene suddenly jumps to another character for them to interject. The extra 1-2 seconds in between the NPCs delivering their lines because of this cut makes the conversations a bit stilted. 

At times, a 3rd NPC was meant to be talking to the NPC I was talking to, but they delivered the lines to me, staring deep into my eyes, while referring to the other NPC. Other times, the NPCs looked in another direction as if they were talking to someone else, so perhaps this is more of a bug.
	This locked in convo style is identical to Outer Worlds, and I find it hard to believe that they did not take at least a passing inspiration from that game's convo system with how damn similar they are.

Skill choices ([Progression](../Gameplay_Systems/Progression.md)) can be referenced in speech. When asked why I would be suited for the role by the recruiter, I could mention my high Fitness on behalf of my Fitness skill point.
	I still, however, could not mention my background as a Soldier.
		This later came up in UC SysDef. As Bethesda uses multiple quest writes, some have covered their bases for skill and background choices and others havent. [Poor_Planning](../Development/Poor_Planning.md) once again, is it possible that said background [•Gameplay_Systems](../Gameplay_Systems/•Gameplay_Systems.md) wasn't implemented at the time of some of these quests being written, and they were not retroactively upgraded?

Surprised to see that a higher-up in the UC who I had to report for the UC Security I picked up back on stream made a joke about how I was overqualified given that I am now a captain in the Vanguard. That’s the level of detail that is often lacking in Bethesda games, so it’s appreciated.

Speaking to Sophie Jex at Neon entrance: Cannabis reference line with “I have a medical license”. Which Sarah dislikes. Feels out of place for the game, odd commentary or just a throw-away joke?

Line rewrite for Cora is humorous but shows a lack of care. She ends a sentence with Brr, but there was no reason why, unless the line previously mentioned something being “cool”. But “cool” was replaced with “exciting”, making the whole Brr quip completely nonsensical. Maybe I should end all my sentences with that… Brr.

Some people enjoy the trait/skill-based dialogue options. I have seen it done far better in other games, so the novelty wore off years ago, but I’m glad this helps other less hardcore gamers feel attached to their character.

Having NPCs cut off each other in dialogue is possible; the [Tracker's_Alliance](../New_Updates/Tracker's_Alliance.md) free Hannibal quest does it. So it’s not an engine issue, but a QA issue. That’s even more egregious.
	^ Apparently, this quest has [Starborn](../Main_Quest/Starborn.md) dialogue? Need to check.

The characters are all too polite, to an awkward degree. It robs the interactions of any drama as everyone is so curt with one another, with barely any abrasion. The game feels like a squeaky clean list of talking points where everyone accepts every single flaw in one another and the world at all times. It's boring, and makes the rare explosive encounter when companions air their feelings of disgust feel so out of place.

Tonal inconsistency.
