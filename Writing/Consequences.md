I am murdering my way through this game. Every quest I can try to fail, saying the rudest options, being an asshole. Doesn't matter. No one seems to even remember being shot by my character. The only thing that happens is I get a bounty. The number of essential NPCS is just terrible, to the point that if I find an NPC to kill, it feels rewarding.

How am I supposed to be immersed if my actions don't have consequences? This is the perfect game to have implications with the [NG+](NG+.md). These are not the kind of decisions that will let a game last 5 years.

I am not murdering everyone just to be a psychopath (Even though that is valid and the path of [The Hunter](The%20Hunter.md)). For roleplaying purposes, there are a few quests I want to fail. I wanted to fail out of the UC or FSC and turn that into a defining moment that would shape my character into a pirate. 

Like all Bethesda games, they mean for the story and world to be experienced from multiple perspectives, as different playthroughs. Like a melee/stealth focused vault-dweller who is generally helpful, then ranged weapon guy who nukes cities, or black-hand thieves guild khajit run vs an arena fighter half-orc. There is different dialog for each race/class/alignment. A lot of the investment in "depth" for Bethesda games is aimed at multiple playthroughs in this manner.

[NG+](NG+.md) in Starfield works almost like a QoL enhancement, in that you can reset everything to try out a completely new alignment or style without having to grind through all the early Exploration and QoL skills again.
	Choices should've been meaningful and impactful. Instead, I can do whatever I want, join any faction, and do nearly all of the things consequence free. Choices should hard lock you out of different paths (i.e. vanguard vs. ranger).
		The way they implemented many of them in Starfield was a mushy middle ground. They didn’t want to lock out content from people who didn’t want to engage with NG+, but ended up just making the game shittier in the process.
