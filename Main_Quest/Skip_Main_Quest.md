The “speedrun” version of the MQ gimps the non-companion members of [Constellation](Constellation.md) - removing conversation options entirely. I can’t even tell Matteo that I’m a part of his [Religion](Writing/Religion.md).
Maybe added later in development when they realised some players would want to rush universes to maximise powers.

The speedrun MQ has the player picking up the random [POI](Exploring/Points_of_Interest.md) [Artifacts](Artifacts.md), will see [Constellation](Constellation.md) complete their unique missions on their, with the help of the player’s precognition. 
This implies that someone had to do Entangled? With the universe jumping… Barrett could feasibly do it as he, too, has touched the artefacts and has a power, but there is no reference to this whatsoever.
It also implies that they all touched the artefacts themselves and have seen the visions; they are all scared and have access to the powers as well. Of course, there is no way to discuss this with them, and it seems that this was added fairly last minute.

Petrov's stutter during the multi-verse segments of the Buried Temple implies that [Starborn](Starborn.md) can command people/possess them through the multi-verse - or the Creators can. OR Petrov is/was a Starborn - but if that were the case, he wouldn't be so enthralled with the single [Artifacts\artifact](Artifacts%5Cartifact) that he has

The speedrun NG+ seems bugged. Barrett is thanking me for rescuing him when it was other [Constellation](Constellation.md) members who did that. His wording isn’t ambiguous enough to imply that he is thankful for us giving them the required information.
