Not a huge fan of Constellation and how quickly you are pushed into them- they should have been more of a mystery, rather than getting a ship from them and being able to join them so quickly.
	It should’ve been the equivalent of your first time answering the call to High Hrothgar to meet the Greybeards in Skyrim, or meeting Mr. House in the Lucky 88 penthouse in New Vegas. An intriguing introduction to a faction offering greater insight into the core storyline and enriching the sense of world-building, all while complementing the central faction questlines.

Constellation is looking for the unknown. Seemingly intelligent life? Or at least something different than the mundane reality that life exists, but it’s mostly normal-looking plants, and kinda weird, but not too much, livestock.

Constellation will not punish you for breaking the law, as in they won't kick you out, but don’t worry, every companion from there will bitch about it. Even the “darkest” choice, Andreja.

Constellation as we meet them:
4 field operatives -
	Sam, on a mission
	Andreja, on a mission
	Barret, collecting the player (but he should've bloody came with us. Him staying back *does* characterise Barrett as helpful, but also far too trusting)
	Sarah, back at base - also the leader
3 researchers / data crunchers -
	Matteo, the thinker
	Noel, the logical one
	Vlad, ...Russian
1 funder -
	Walter, basically retired CEO spending his days avoiding his wife in a nice lodge retreat he bankrolled

^ It would make sense that constellation, funded by a rich megacorp CEO, would be a group of misfits from different paths of life who would come together for a shared interest in exploration and archaeology. Instead, Starfield makes a hobby centered meetup group into something more than it needs to be.

Based around "[•Exploring](../Exploring/•Exploring.md)", but the game world takes place in "the settled systems". every single planet/moon/pebble has already been discovered, explored, catalogued. there is literally not a single item, crafting material, mineral, weapon, armour, wonder that you cannot purchase from the first general store you come across. its actually impossible to discover anything in the whole universe, even the artifacts have hundreds of [Starborn](Starborn.md) that have discovered them and just want another ride on the rollercoaster.

#### The Mission Board inconsistency
For a group of explorers, they don't seem to have surveyed a lot of the universe.

Will add an interesting narrative of defending the game *not* because I like it, but because the critiques should be valid. Also raise the point that these mistakes are made because of how obscured this information is in-game. Then again though, expo dumping it upon first meeting constellation probably wouldn't be better.

Mission board mission that requires me to identify a specific geographical trait in one system. (Said system has like 15 moons/planets too, and the payout is only 3k credits and 250xp - not worth the time investment, even if you enjoy the RP aspect of this play-style).
	Scanning skill at max allows the player to have a chance to identify a trait by scanning from space, but without this, the effort of this mission is really not worth it.
