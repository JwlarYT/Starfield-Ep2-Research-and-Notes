The final boss battle was crazy across multiple arenas. There's quite a bit of expected jank, but it's still quite thrilling. Not very difficult though, even on VH.

Stakes are… low, and personal. Not exactly as grand as their other games, but that’s fine.

You can choose one of the [Starborn](Starborn.md) as your ally, or fight them both. They mention that this has happened time and time again, yet they were surprised when I first found the artefacts and met them for the first time. They shouldn’t be that surprised either, there are seemingly thousands of Starborn trying to find the artefacts, to the point that it’s far too convenient that we didn’t see any until we got to a certain point in the story (outside of stumbling across the Hunter or Emissary in bars). I’ve fought so many in these arena battles, you’d think they would’ve overran the entire Settled Systems with how OP they are.

A non-zero per cent of these will be versions of our crew that went with us as well.

The universe jumps to seeing myself dead in Vlad’s arms [glitched](../Development/Bugs.md) out like crazy. It’s always a shame when Bethesda’s poor [Quality_Assurance](../Development/Quality_Assurance.md) harms what should be an emotional moment like this.
