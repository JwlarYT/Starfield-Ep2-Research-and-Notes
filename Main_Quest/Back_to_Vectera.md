Fixing PC for Lin. Two methods of completion are available: hack the PC using a digipick or turn the power back on with emergency batteries, which can be found nearby. 
Lin not being able to use [digipicks](../Gameplay_Systems/Lockpicking.md) is understandable, but why couldn't she use the emergency power? As an expert in [Outpost_Management](../Gameplay_Systems/Outpost_Management.md), specifically hired by Argos Extractions for that exact job, I’m sure she understands how. 
One can see it as her giving up or not caring. She’s waiting for an evacuation, as far as I can tell (she doesn’t say this, and since everyone else has already been extracted, I'm unsure why she's still here). On the off chance the player comes by? That’s convenient. 
If she *was* trying to access that computer to find out where Heller and Barrett were taken, she’s done a poor job at it.

Heller - "Barret was all smiles about crash landing."
Yeah, because that’s way cooler than anything we get to do in this game. (Cut to shooting the flight console in a boarded ship to show we cannot do the same.)

The [Dialogue](../Writing/Dialogue.md) for offering Heller medical help reads as if it should be a Medicine requirement (another skill in the game), but as with the Tracking skill in [Space_Gameplay](../Gameplay_Systems/Space_Gameplay.md) earlier, the game lets you fix him up without any prerequisite. 
Seems like a bit of cowardice in regards to ‘locking away’ content behind skills. Either embrace a skill system that reflects in dialogue, or don’t have one; don’t have this half-hearted approach! What skills can be used in [Dialogue](../Writing/Dialogue.md) don't unlock anything special or progress a quest faster, etc. It simply adds a new line of dialogue in response, and the conversation proceeds as usual. It's at least recognition, which is the bare minimum, but no [Role-Playing](../Gameplay_Systems/Role-Playing.md) is added beyond that.

Heller's planet is randomly chosen, so his situation can make sense or not. On the one hand, it's good for the entire Unity multiverse, on the other, it causes mind-boggling moments, such as living on a planet with zero oxygen.

At least take a bloody med-pack or something, so we know he didn’t miraculously repair himself in an instant. Yeah, yeah, I know he’s on painkillers, and the motivation of someone being here to save him may have helped. Perhaps my brain is too RPG-coded from years of playing games like this, but I can’t help but feel like there’s a variety of skill checks that have been axed during these segments.

So far, the story seems too scared to commit. Heller should’ve died. I dislike how the guy is on his deathbed, and then can suddenly stand back up and join your crew. Worse still, you can leave him there for weeks, months, years and come back whenever you want to recruit him. And all he will have to say is, “Hey man, I need to get off the rock.” Did he never consider going to one of the nearby landing pads, both of which had ships on them when I was there? They’re only half a KM away. 
	Because some people may want to have quippy Heller on their ship, Beth were too scared to kill him off. The same for Lin being able to join your crew. Why must every NPC who had more than 10 voice lines suddenly be special enough to recruit? Can they not just be another person among the millions in the universe, able to live their own lives without the hero coming to be their saviour?
		Then again, at least these minor [Companions](../Gameplay_Systems/Companions.md) are still a developed to some degree.
