If Other Victor is a Starborn, he also probably witnessed our extinction if we stayed on Earth, forcing him to make an impossible choice, saving humanity for what he perceives as a better future in place of our demise on Earth. Parallels The Avengers' Infinity War plotline with Dr Strange seeing every possible future and realising that sacrificing half of all life was the only outcome that succeeds.
	The reason I bring up Marvel is that it is definitely in the wheelhouse of Emil's level of writing.
	
I can understand Other Victor's actions, even if it doesn't justify them. Starborn, especially the player, lose all values and ethics behind our actions as they are insignificant. We can choose to launch mind-control chips to the public, take out the dominant police force to aid pirates in pillaging the stars and it all doesn't matter because we can jump somewhere else when needed. What Victor chose is what he deemed necessary to force mankind into the stars.
	Which raises the question of how Starfield's multiverses work. 
	Are they complete universes that are unique from their inception at the Big Bang? If so, the chances that Other Victor's mission of forcing mankind into the stars is occurring in every single universe are somewhat low, no? Yet, every one we can visit will have this plot point intact. 
		This implies that Other Victor isn't a starborn, but was the unity itself, implicating some divine will upon mankind in every universe ever. Raising a further question of who created the artefacts, and what is their goal?
			Probably goes back to Emil's interview on the implications of faith and creationism and how conflicted he felt during the design. Did God make the artefacts? Is it God's will that Victor kills billions in a Noah's Ark style escape from Earth? Are the artefacts a placeholder for the burning bush? 
			Or did someone else make them, Starborn from the distant future, a precursor alien race? 
				I can certainly see the appeal to the fans of this lore and its philosophical implications, if only the game this lore pertained to didn't have the design issue-ridden quandary that is Starfield.
