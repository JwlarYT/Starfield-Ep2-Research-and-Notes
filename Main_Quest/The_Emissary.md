Keep [Artifacts](Artifacts.md) away from people who don't understand its power, like the old Earth people who destroyed their atmosphere. But then again, who would I give the powers to then? It's a roundabout way of saying "keep all powers for yourself".

"Look at this guy, he's dead! He's dead-dead. Are you sad yet?...oh look he's alive just kidding he's a weird space magic alternate self."

If I take the Emissary's advice, then again I'll have to play NG+ over and over to keep the powers away from the "Unworthy".
