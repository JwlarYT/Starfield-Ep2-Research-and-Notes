Multiple ways to approach the Astral Lounge quest. Use Neon Security to help you.
There are optional missions before the meeting that make it go far more smoothly, I appreciate this inclusion (bribing the guards and hacking the doors). Although they are trivial and barely an inconvenience to the point that ignoring them is barely worth the time save. They also cannot be failed (barring not having enough money) which does make it feel less of an achievement when you get to use them.

The twist with Slayton Aerospace was foreshadowed with the seller investigation, so wasn’t a huge surprise, but was an interesting point gameplay wise. 
A rare occasion where full murder hobo mode was accommodated for. Although the game did make this obvious with the guards being highlighted as hostile as soon as you enter - reminded me of Daggerfall’s dungeons and the ‘fake’ guards. 

The peaceful solution has an on rails stealth mission following instructions - interesting enough, but I would’ve preferred this being less hand-holdy - but it does help characterise the power the ultra-wealth like Issa and Shroud possess. 

Talking down the CEO was easy enough, perhaps too easy. It’s hard to see the appeal of the speech perks - barely ever does failing a persuasion check really make the game any harder. 

Speech options aren’t always obvious. I asked the CEO whether he wanted to kill the thief as I was interested in his point of view - I did not read this as a choice that I was willing to do to the killing myself. Regardless, Sarah saw it as that and scolded me. I chose to send the thief to jail, where Sarah then said he should be left on an Asteroid to rot - essentially saying he should die. Just this time she gets to wash her hands of the blood…

Final twist comes as we enter orbit with a Starborn intercepting us and asking to hand over the artifact. I chose to escape using my grav drive. 
	Need to check what handing over artifact does.
		Can you fight the ship? (Doubt it)

[Slayton](Cities/Neon_City.md) dungeon finally used. Coming here earlier to grab the codes paid off and avoided a fight. Wonder what will happen if I wipe the place first. 
Guided stealth section for part 2 of the dungeon. Either [Quality_Assurance](Development/Quality_Assurance.md) playtesting found that doing this [stealthily](../Gameplay_Systems/Stealth.md) was too hard and this was the compromise (like films expo dumping in the opening credits based on test screenings) or Emil was feeling some Mission Impossible during the writing. 
	This section feels huge, need to check out how it plays as a straight up combat dungeon.

Negotiating with the Slayton CEO. Seems we can make a deal or kill him. If we make a deal, he gives us a choice on what to do with the dealer we bought the [artifact](Artifacts.md) from. With no gameplay system tied to morality, choices like this have little meaning past [Role-Playing](../Gameplay_Systems/Role-Playing.md), but RP is enough of a reason. 
He was poor and unemployed so I let him go, the choices were freedom, prison or execution. Walter was pleased to see that I was not corrupted by [Neon_City](Cities/Neon_City.md)'s shadiness and lack of legal consequences.

[Bugs](Development/Bugs.md): The receptionist still acted like she should have at the start of the infiltration, even after I had already talked to and negotiated with her boss.

Meeting the ['Helix’](The_Pilgrim.md) after the Neon segment, our first official encounter with a [Starborn](Starborn.md). They are written to seem like an alien race, but the lines make no sense with the knowledge that these are just humans who made it to the [Unity](Unity.md). This one acts as if he is not human himself, delusional? Or just shoddy [Writing](Writing/Writing.md) to force the twist…
	As level scaling isn’t a thing, I was able to overpower the Helix with a superior [ship](../Gameplay_Systems/Space_Gameplay.md), something even the journal entry wasn’t ready for. This is good imo, rewarding players for playing the game. Need to see what happens if we give him the artifact instead.
