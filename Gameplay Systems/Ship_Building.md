You can upgrade specific parts of your ship without interacting with the more complicated ship-building mechanics. Parts include weapons, a power reactor, engines, and a grav drive. Cannot increase storage this way.

The economy is weighted towards shipbuilding. Getting credits is surprisingly easy. Weapons and space suits, boost packs etc. will sell for high numbers even with a low commerce skill.

The shipbuilder is sadly far more limited than what the marketing in the [Starfield_Direct](Starfield_Direct.md) would have you believe. For one, you cannot rotate objects. That means stuff like bay doors to ground cannot go out the back of your ship, they will always face forward.
	Mods fix this, unsurprisingly

It can be quite finicky to move everything around. Parts must fit together like lego, you are free to place them at random as you please.Â 

Upgrading/building the ship is very expensive. I spent over 30k credits to increase crew limit to 4 and the cargo hold by an additional 200kg.

It would likely be easier for players who want to really customise the ship to instead delete everything and start from scratch. Building around the limitation of the default Frontier was quite difficult as you do not immediately know what is of importance, and the order they must be placed.

Eg. The ramp must connect to the hull/crew quarters, which must connect to the docking port and the cockpit. Extra storage is free to slot where you can. Weapons must be connected to pieces that will accept them. Etc etc.

When adding new items to a ship, it is easy to lose the item inside the structure, making it impossible to find it and attach it to the ship, forcing you to use Ctrl Z and try again.

[Level gating](Progression.md) is stupid; they should just be stuck behind massive paywalls. The player is also never informed that they should be actively keeping their ship up-to-date to match their level, so some may be confused about why they are struggling in space battles so much. 
I have an upgraded ship I stole from a random ship landing POI in a level 30 star system, and it is more than powerful enough for every battle in the main story so far, including against multiple [Starborn](Starborn.md).

Even the Bethesda-made ships have nonsensical ladder placement.

No ships have blueprints; you have to remake them every time.
