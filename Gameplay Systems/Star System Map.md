Stars in red are stars you cannot reach in a single [[Travelling|grav jump]], requiring the player to jump multiple times or upgrade their [[Ship Building|ship]]/[[Progression|skills]].

Some space encounters can be seen on the star system map. These are often dungeons (space stations) or friendly NPC traders. ([[• Exploring]])

Starmap needs a search bar. If you’re gonna go back to so many Daggerfall style choices, why remove that one. It’s the most helpful on a map full of nondescript coloured dots.
