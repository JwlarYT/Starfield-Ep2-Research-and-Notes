Camera mode comes with a lot of options, including filters, frames, player poses, texture overlays and more - perfect for those who want to play around and make the most of the vast vistas the moons and planets offer. Controls on PC play 2nd fiddle to controller again however, the sliders and all of the camera mode menu options can only be changed using the keyboard and arrow keys. The mouse is locked to positioning the camera - making it a laborious task to finely tweak photos (especially the DOF sliders).
