Stars in red are stars you cannot reach in a single [grav jump](Exploring/Travelling.md), requiring the player to jump multiple times or upgrade their [ship](Gameplay%20Systems/Ship_Building.md)/[skills](Gameplay%20Systems/Progression.md).

Some space encounters can be seen on the star system map. These are often dungeons (space stations) or friendly NPC traders. ([•Exploring](Exploring/•Exploring.md))

Starmap needs a search bar. If you’re gonna go back to so many Daggerfall style choices, why remove that one. It’s the most helpful on a map full of nondescript coloured dots.
