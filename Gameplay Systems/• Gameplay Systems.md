 Many games are definitive; Sarfield is derivative.
 
 Create Venn Diagram to show how the systems do and don’t interact with one another.

^ It is designed almost antiethically, where the systems clash so often and cancel each other out too much. Such as [[Ship Building]] being so open ended and intricate with the level of customisation possible with weapons, performance, exterior and interior appearance, yet it sits within a [[Travelling|space traversal]] sequence comprised of small skirmishes and glamour shot loading cutscenes.

The wide range of gameplay features/mechanics/loops, which is Starfield’s strength (USP); but there is a stage where you may feel there’s a lack of depth per gameplay feature/mechanic/loop, or the repetitions start to become tedious, which is Starfield’s weakness.

If you’re the kind of player who prefers to keep going around doing different features, it’s not so bad. But if you’re the kind of player who likes to dig deep into one or two specific features, you might eventually find things lacking.

Starfields' appeal is that it is a massive sprawling space-based open world sandbox with stronger on-foot elements than any of its competitors. Its reception shows that on-foot gameplay is extremely low on the list of what most space-sim players want.

Starfield takes the worst part of a Bethesda game and pushes it together, the worst writing, worst story, worst characters, worst world-building, worst gameplay loop and so on.
