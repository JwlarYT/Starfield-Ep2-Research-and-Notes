The randomly generated quests are pretty simple and very obvious so far. I was given a job by a mining supervisor to check out a local cave and report back on what mineral I found. The cave was stunningly beautiful, adorned with huge sapphire-like crystals. 

I was paid a meager sum for my efforts, but these jobs are just that. Jobs. 

They’re designed to push you to explore and to give you a few credits if you want them. They are clearly marked in the quest log under “missions”. These certainly aren’t the selling point of the game, but they’re a nice time waster and more importantly, they facilitate [Role-Playing](Role-Playing.md). Maybe my character wants to be a miner on the Moon, why not? It’s better to have the choice be there than not.

Mission boards in bars are a way of finding radiant quests that appeal to the classic Elite 1-3 style space sim quests. Including transporting people and cargo, hunting pilots or [Surveying](Surveying.md) [Planets](Planets.md). Their pay is measly at only 2-4k credits per job, you can often sell a looted gun for more, but at least the jobs exist for those who wanted those RP options, like me.
	^ Seeing as these simple missions that don’t necessarily require fighting exist, I again wish there was a more ‘simple’ opening where the player starts as a new migrant to a city of their choosing. Then they can take jobs like this to make some cash and earn a name for themselves as an early-game [Progression](Progression.md) style. I’m sure an ‘Alternate Start’ mod will fulfil this need, but why is it that we must always rely on modders to make the games better…
		This also facilitates a passive playthrough, which is impossible due to the forced opening

There certainly is a Daggerfall-ness to the radiant quests. 
+ Turning up at a marked outpost, 
+ Talking to the resident job giver and grabbing you a simple task. 
Sometimes it’s clearing out an adjacent outpost from Spacers or [Crimson Fleet](Crimson%20Fleet.md). Or it's a fetch quest under the guise of placing science equipment or surveying a nearby cave for potential mining ores. The variety (at least from what I've seen so far) is unironically worse than that of a 28-year-old, which is a shame. 

The mission board missions help to fill that gap, but the leniency in the menu system for travel makes that system significantly less immersive than in the games that inspired its inclusion. The entire time I interact with those missions, I can’t help but think how Elite 2, from nearly 40 years ago, did the same but with better immersion. 
A shame that such a dated title can compete and even win out in such a comparison.

Found a radiant bounty mission from an NPC living in a [Lone Hab](Points%20of%20Interest.md) on a rock [planet](Planets.md). She asked me to help her take out an [Ecliptic](Ecliptic.md) Merc at a near-by hideout. I met her at the quest location, but then her NPC pathfinding led her astray, so I completed the bounty on my own and shared the loot with her as she had requested. 
	A lot of these kinds of missions sound fine in the design room, but all the moving parts need to work for maximum immersion. The [high cliffs](Procedural%20Generation.md) of this planet had the hideout on a plateau, and this is what confused her pathfinding. 
		If NPCs were capable of using their boostbacks more freely, this wouldn't be an issue. As it stands, they only use boost packs in particular situations, usually inside a dungeon near a ledge.

Radiant missions can and will repeat. I have been asked to kill a group of nearby spacers by two NPCs working on two completely different construction sites in two different star systems. They had the same VO, and even the optional dialogue was greyed out. The game isn’t even trying to hide that this is repeated content.
	Just like Daggerfall, but again, the latter had far more quests and different variations of said quests. 



#### Intended Player Interaction
I started a 45-minute session with the intent of playing as I imagine the designers expected us to interact with the radiant part of the game. 

I began by selecting to explore a ship icon in the Alpha Centauri system, located near [New Atlantis](New%20Atlantis.md). 

This brought me into an exciting zero-G dungeon where the generator was damaged, turning on and off, sending myself and enemy pirates flying across the room as we battled it out. I can’t think of any game off the top of my head that has done this so well in first person. 

Once I had wiped that dungeon and looted it for all that it was worth, I scanned the nearby moon, landing at the Mining Outpost POI highlighted on the map. 
+ Here, the foreman asked us to kill some Spacers nearby that were giving them trouble. 
+ We travel to the Abandoned Research Tower using the car (it was 2 km away, that time sink would’ve killed any enthusiasm, which is why [Ground vehicles](Ground%20vehicles.md)  are a good game enhancer - I couldn’t even use [Surveying](Surveying.md) to fill that trek as this moon only had two minerals to find). 
+ We wiped out the Spacers in a standard enough [dungeon ](Points%20of%20Interest.md)romp, and returned for our credits. 

Then flying over the next moon (using the menu of course, the idea of “flying” anywhere in this game is just a fabrication). 

As we enter the new area, we help out some [United Colonies](United%20Colonies.md) SysDef against a couple of [Ecliptic](Ecliptic.md) Mercs, earning some credits in reward. 

Then landed on the marked Fracking Station [POI](Points%20of%20Interest.md) to grab a quest to scout out a nearby mine. This seemed like a standard task I had done before, but when I searched inside, I found a sick colonist who needed some help. This minor twist wasn’t revolutionary by any means; he only needed a med pack to get back on his feet, but it at least added some extra flavour atop the usual job. 
	It turns out that this was a rare occasion where the radiant quest system intersected. The injured miner is an isolated quest that just happened to spawn at the time.

After obtaining our credits, we secure a transport job from the mission board at the fracking station, where we taxi two miners back to [New Atlantis](New%20Atlantis.md). 

Finalising the session by selling the hard-fought loot.

It was a decent time, and made me appreciate the variety of radiant missions and gameplay options available. I just wish everything weren’t so disconnected. This type of gameplay is contradictory with the [main quest](•%20Main%20Quest.md) and [faction](•%20Factions.md), feeling like its own indie game bundled with a spanning space RPG, rather than a cohesive package. Not to mention the [outpost system](Outpost%20Management.md), [ship builder](Ship%20Building.md) et al.
