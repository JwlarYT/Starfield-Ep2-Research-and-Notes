The purpose of the main story isn't "Save the world and play NG+" OR "Save your son and play NG+". NO.

Ultimately, my stance on the main story being an elaborate scheme to keep players playing NG+ remains unchanged. It raises many questions, sure, but the answer is always NG+. If you are satisfied with just the questions and don't want any answers, then I'm glad you enjoyed the story. After my first run, I felt ripped off, and the more I thought about it, the conclusion I came to was this.

The way they integrated [[Unity]] and NG+ narratively is creative and an interesting meta-commentary on gaming. You can make your game a commentary on the consequences of a particular behaviour. Still, if there are no consequences that matter (and that the player can *change* significantly through their actions, and those actions are relevant to the commentary), then it falls flat.

It changes how you view the game, because you're rewarded for not engaging any system too deeply (why ever build an [[Outpost Management|outpost]]), and it makes balancing powers a nightmare because if they get better for 10 rounds of NG+, they have to suck from the start. It's now a chore to go through the game 10 times to experience the fascinating world you play in.

Starfield expected players to keep coming back for 10 years, but did not do enough to persuade people to be invested in doing so.
On a single playthrough of the main quest, all faction quests, plus some side quests and exploring, the player has probably scratched the surface of base building and ship building because all of their skill points have been placed somewhere else. After that, we're expected to go into NG+ without any ships or bases we have built, and then focus on levelling and earning credits to partake in that endgame content loop, with little reason to replay those questlines. 

I like the idea of NG+ but it should be like a fresh start, new traits, new background, new look, but you can keep your XP and add on to what you had (crafting and skills and eventually the exploration you've done), you're replacing an alternate version of you in this universe. However, you should be able to acquire a starborn ship, ship parts, armour, and so on. And powers shouldn't get substantially (or at all) better each round.
	They added some of these features in an [[Bug Fixes & Other Changes|update]], but they aren't implemented perfectly - traits, for example, are missing some of their functionality.

However, if they wanted NG+ to be a core feature, the way they implemented it doesn't play nicely. You can skip specific dialogue interactions, but doing so sometimes leaves you worse off than you originally were. The world is wildly inconsistent in its awareness of your starborn status, and when you can and cannot use it is also erratic. 

For example, you cannot use any of your past knowledge in the companion quests, because understandably, that would've been creepy. 
They make that clear, yet they are still happy to be romanced all over again. 
They should be more apprehensive than doing it now, as a multi-dimensional being that knows their darkest secrets, and yet we're forced to complete their quests as if we've just met them, because we may have. I didn't complete the companion quests in my first universe, for example. 

As no information is carried over from the past universe other than the player and our level, etc., this would be somewhat broken. Still, it could have been solved by using introductory speech options, as BGS has already done, by expanding on them further.
+ Have one option explaining how we were in love in a past universe. This would make most of them wary of the player and harder to romance from now on due to the creep factor, but I could see someone like Barrett not being overly concerned about it, so that it wouldn't bother him. 
+ Then, have a second option stating that we were friends; this would work similarly to the current BGS option. They're all weirded out about it, but agree to start fresh, possibly raising affinity with some of them based on the following choices. 
+ The final options are along the lines of us just being colleagues or not knowing each other, which would keep affinities neutral. 
 
Done well, it would have enhanced the game, but as it stands, it detracts from the idea of a vast, expansive world to explore and transform. 

Doing NG+ for the first time, and I take Sarah to the [[Starborn]] ship for the first time, and she says, “This ship is starting to feel like home”. No! It was an immersion-breaking moment.
Even just bringing her to the ship, and she has no question about who you are or what this future/alien-tech that ship is. If you ever accidentally reveal the ship to any of them, it will immediately expose you.

You show up in a suit and ship beyond known [[starborn|technology]]. You drop hints at knowing stuff beyond their knowledge, and everyone is just like huh, that's a weird thing to say anyway... I was looking forward to having to talk my way out of awkward situations when they realised I'm not a typical miner.
	You can achieve this with the 'skip main quest' option, but it's one or the other. No middle ground. At least they were wise to hide what must've been the craziest expo-dump of all time in a fade to black. Forces us to head-canon the back-and-forth discussion and disbelief that must've occurred.

NG+ speech options are limited, and I feel rushed on the skipped MQ option. Probably intentional to let those players who want to speedrun Temples and Universes get to it. Choosing speedrunners over writing is an odd choice. Need to check out the ‘re-do MQ’ option on the next go around.

Emil pussyfooted his [[Unity]] ending. 
They needed more to push the player into going through it, to make staying back a real conundrum. Maybe make the Universe 1 powers more pathetic, like Fus when you first get it in Skyrim, with the possibility of upgrading them to become stupidly powerful, be the real attraction. This is kind of how it is done, but the elemental powers you get are still strong enough for the player to be content with them.

Despite this, the power trip is excellent. This is the best zero-to-hero growth I’ve felt in a Bethesda since Morrowind. A combination of non-level-scaled enemies and fun abilities, especially combining phased time with gravity waves to plough through even the most challenging bosses. You do feel like you’ve become [[the Hunter]] from that initial escape mission, just decimating everything without even trying.

Lol, future tech [[Starborn]] ships are worth a hair more than the base Frontier. As if people like Walter wouldn't be clamouring hand over fist to get their hands on this and reverse engineer it.

The [[Starborn]] ship is mighty with the help of its stunlock missile. You can certainly outrank it with your custom ship, even with the maxed-out NG+10 Starborn variant. Still, I do enjoy being able to hit the Starborn ship back with their own medicine that made the space battle in the original universe so difficult.

Barrett and Lin on Argos do not react to the player’s [[Starborn]] nature or the new ship at ALL. 
You can’t even use a [[Starborn]] option on them - they just assume we have finished the intro mission as usual. This is the very first planet we see after the [[Unity]] and they failed to account for players ignoring the Mission Log directing us to the Lodge? NG+ wasn’t entirely planned for.
	^Especially egregious when there is a master lock opposite the mine lift from the beginning of the game. Players could, of course, come back here in the original universe, but with how it requires the maximum level of [[lockpicking]], it feels more likely that players would only come here for the loot in NG+. Also, the loot is, as usual, randomised and tied to the level of the star system, so it’s crap and not worth the time getting anyway.

The [[Unity]] NG+ can’t decide whether it’s a big-brain way to replay the game by being a built-in mechanic, or just your standard NG+ where the player isn’t expected to [[Role-Playing|role-play]] a multiverse jumping super being… BUT we ARE doing that. That’s how Starfield’s NG+ works, and yet unless we choose to skip the entire main quest, we can’t truly experience that. [[Poor Planning]]!

For instance, why do I have to talk to Sarah’s contact again? I prefer a Starborn dialogue option to say, “This guy, Moara, in the Sol System has it; I think he should be flying around here around this time. Let’s go check it out.” 
And when questioned how we know this, we could either pretend to be a savant, saying, “Trust me, I just know” to play them along like a fiddle, or straight up drop the whole [[Starborn]] lore dump.

It really does seriously boggle my mind that Bethesda didn't capitalize on the NG+ concept more. Like yeah Bethesda does tend to play things safe and rarely locks the player out of content because they are basically afraid of telling the player "No" and want to let people do anything and everything in one run. But they gave themselves the PERFECT excuse to finally take some harder stances. To give the player some meaningful choices that lock them out of factions and questlines with no way to go back and change them. Because NOW they could go "Well you're in a new universe so why not explore some different options!"

All dialogue options, and Foretold middle quest to skip to end

It would take a lot of work, more time than they had probably, but I wish the NG+ [[dialogue]] options, rather than being a skip mechanic, created new branching storylines. Like you’re aware the pirates will come back to Vectera so there’s a NG+ dialogue option to ambush them with the miners, actually save them, which creates a new storyline. They did it with saving your companion in NG+, I’d love it if they had done that more.

Some quest designers implemented NG+ way better than others. A small quest to find a Tea recipe for some guys at a coffee bar on Paradiso has multiple NG+ options for each time you go through, the Starborn dialogue changes until you finally remember the recipe and give it directly without needing to go talk to the lady on the roof. One of the only skip quest options I have found.
