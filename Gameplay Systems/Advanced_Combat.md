Boost packs are essential for making combat far more dynamic and enjoyable, and aiding exploration.

Climbing is back!! It works great in first and third person with passable mantling animations. Traversing verticality does not seem to be impeded by any invisible walls, however it is sad to see a lack of hidden collectibles or loot for players who utilize this ability to reach areas that seem unintended to be found ( like a tree garden in [New_Atlantis](New_Atlantis.md) I climbed up to ).

Jump boosting in low gravity between structures, combined with mantling animations creates an exhilarating combat scenario when battling multiple enemies in an area surrounded by tall structures. This is the best FPS implementation by Bethesda yet. 

A good, but annoying problem - there are too many cool powers. I want to use all of these, but can only fit so many to hotkeys. Having to open this menu to chain them together completely kills the thrill. Additionally, chaining them together requires either the use of Quantum Essence, which must be accessed from this menu, or completing the task of finding all 240 temples and levelling up all powers to maximum. Not worth it. It seems like they want us to mod this game and fix it/customise it for them.
	I know a big part of this video is about showing how Starfield could be improved by following what has worked before, but I’m unsure if porting the magic system from TES was entirely necessary. Part of me wishes they had stuck to the sterility of the world they designed—a pure, grounded-in-realism space-sim RPG. I may not have been a fan of it personally, but at least I could respect how much they stuck to it.
		It's not like an interesting game couldn't exist within that world, just look at the Colony Wars lore ([History](History.md)).

#### AI
It isn’t comparable to *actual* FPS games, partly due to the enemy AI lacking in a few areas, but it is better than expected.
	They can't open doors for example, and will stare at you like gimps through a window rather than close the gap or make any kind of reasonable human action. Leads to funny combat scenarios. How is the AI dumber than in previous games lol
		Their are mods that make the AI much smarter, which fixes these bugs
			Seeing as the [modders](Reliance_on_Mods.md) fixed this so fast, one would believe that their is some merit to these AI actions being coded into the game, and left unused by either a bug or [idiotic choice](Poor_Planning.md) to make combat much easier
				If that WAS the decision, why not actually tie AI to [Difficulty_options](Difficulty_options.md) for once?
