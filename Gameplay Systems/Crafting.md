The weapon upgrade system is ported directly from FO4, but its progression is made even slower. In FO4, better upgrades were locked behind perks, in Starfield, theyâ€™re closed between [skill points](Progression.md) AND research, which is done via its own crafting menu and requires its materials. 
Research even has its own skill slot to decrease the materials needed. This levelling system screams F2P mobile game in a $70 title. Why slow down progression arbitrarily like this? To entice players to interact with your main quest, did you mandated [NG+](NG+.md) mode? 
Or to make us want to interact with the [mission board](Radiant_Quests.md) content more frequently for the XP reward.
