After reaching [Constellation](Main%20Quest/Constellation.md), Vasco will introduce the player to Outpost Building with a general overview, focusing on the Scan Booster which will help the player find [POIs](Exploring/Points_of_Interest.md) at a wider distance.

Cargo links have been broken since launch and are still broken. Mine hasn’t worked since it sent 260 to [New_Atlantis](Cities/New_Atlantis.md). I went to check it out and cargo container is filled to the brim with Argon, but the Cargo ship never comes. Tried resetting the cargo link to no avail. I had to grab the argon myself, destroy the entire cargo link platform, and then rebuild it for it to restart. Two years of bug fixing were well spent.

Outposts are mostly tied to [role-play](Gameplay%20Systems/Role-Playing.md) space trucker-type quests. Gather resources to supply [Radiant_Quests](Gameplay%20Systems/Radiant_Quests.md) and Staryards.

XP Grinding with the Outpost is legitimately one of its primary uses. Well, technically, it’s to manufacture large quantities of construction resources. 
But what are these resources used for? Making bigger Outposts, gaining XP and selling for a significant profit. It’s a self-contained system. Even more so than Fallout 4's. At Least FO4's system becomes essential with the help of the Survival Mode.

It’s a simple factory simulator, the problem again being that so many games do this better. That’s Starfield’s “strength”, it’s an ‘everything’ game. You can play ‘Borderlands but worse’ with ‘Factorio but worse’ and ‘Avorion but worse’ and ‘Privateer 2 but worse’ AND a Bethesda-style open world RPG… but worse - All in One! 
Why play five best-in-class games when you can maximise your time within a lesser version of them all to create an overall 6/10 title? That’s the crux for some; that's its appeal. To others, that's its failing.

To give more of a reason to interact with the system, they should have split [Ship_Building](Gameplay%20Systems/Ship_Building.md) costs to the materials we can create. This can be bypassed by high credits for players for don't want to interact with it, but will appeal to those who want to save a buck.
	Kind of already does this by allowing all ship manufacturer parts to be available to an outpost building dock, but this is never told to the player.
 
 Wish they were more worthwhile. The original concept of requiring refuelling depots across the galaxy would have been an awesome togglable option to keep in game.
	 I could see not needing one as they didn't want to force people into mechanics they didn't want to use (like ship-building), but they could've at least fleshed them out. All they had to do was follow Fallout 4's settlement building.

We have too many damn resources. Discounting manufactured ones alone I counted around 78 different types of rocks and organic things compared to Fallout 4's 31. Slamming manufactured stuff like Zero Wire and Gimbals in bloats that up to around 113.

It actually becomes difficult to assign in your mind what goes to what overall. And it becomes hell to track in your inventory due to the sheer number of needed materials.

And there’s no compelling reason to not just buy everything.

With the resources you gather from the base, you can spend them on really fun stuff like other bases, which allow you to get more resources, to build more bases.
