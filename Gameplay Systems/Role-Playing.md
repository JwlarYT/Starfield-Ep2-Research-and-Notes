You are forced to play a [Constellation](Constellation.md) Member AND
	You cannot not be apart of Constellation... without [Reliance on Mods](Reliance%20on%20Mods.md). And BGS surely now that some of the most pipular mods are the start anywhere ones, so why bother inplement that into your Role Playing game, when you know your audience will sort it out in a few weeks.

The one game where it makes the most lore sense to become a murder hobo and you can’t. Many players including myself seem themselves becoming [The Hunter](the%20hunter.md) as they lose connection with the universe and don’t care for its inhabitants, and yet we cannot fully embody the phycopathy of [The Hunter](The%20Hunter.md) because of BGS’ love for un-killable NPCs

What makes you want to kill them? And that answer usually is because they are cardboard, one dimensional and generally unlikeable waste of space. That's why this game need the 'unkillable npc' flag.

They literally have an out with the [Unity](Unity.md). Not just a "the prophecy has been severed" dialogue box. There is a completely canonical reset button this time. No ifs, ands, or buts, the writing is clear as day and the intention is even laid bare with the hunters apathy towards the people they interact with. So why do we need essential NPCs? Let me fail a quest, mess up, kill some people and then reset the universe and try again.

Imagine if Bethesda did some really off the wall challenging stuff in NG+ like if you pick the [Crimson Fleet vs UC SysDef](•%20Crimson%20Fleet-UC%20SysDef.md) you become a permanent enemy of the state of the [UC](United%20Colonies.md) so you have to do very creative things to still complete the main quest while being relentlessly hunted. 

Sequence breaking and reactivity to player choice in the main quest should be way more encouraged given just how it ends. The set up is basically tailor made to abuse that sort of thing, it's not even disappointing so much as bizarre that Bethesda didn't go for it.

Certain traits are linked to [Constellation](Constellation.md), one member gave me a letter from my Dad to kickstart the Kid Stuff trait.

You can remove traits permanently if you know how. The [House of Enlightened](Religion.md) leader in [New Atlantis](New%20Atlantis.md) can remove my Enlightened trait and Introvert trait. Bethesda doesn’t want people fully committing to their choices, I guess. F
rom an RP standpoint, I can understand, though. Religion certainly is something one may struggle with or want to change at some point. Introversion, however, is a bit more challenging to overcome, even with therapy, which is what the leader is offering.

Some traits have interesting effects. Like angering a companion with the Empath trait causes a debuff to your critical success chances (Self Doubt effect) for 20 minutes.

It turns out that being a [United Colonies](United%20Colonies.md) Native doesn’t mean citizenship; everyone has to serve to earn it, essentially making it mandatory service. Given the recent war, that makes sense. 
	^Service also includes working in agriculture, science, and I’m sure mining, too. Becoming a wage slave in exchange for the right to live in [New Atlantis](New%20Atlantis.md) and not some small backwater [Civilian Outpost](Points%20of%20Interest.md).
		What’s the point of the damn trait though, outside of Role-Playing. I really feel no advantage or disadvantage. The greatness of Daggerfall’s system is that it had an RP effect AND a gameplay effect. Not just one or the other. A few dialogue options barely make the choice, or the re-rolling of said choice, worth it. No wonder they didn’t include re-rolling originally; it was only added in a later patch. It only serves to highlight further how little the choices matter.

Roles that work within the sandbox tools we were given:
- Mercenary - clearing POIs of Spacer, Ecliptic, and CF scum
- Bounty Hunter - doing bounties off the mission board
- Constellation Explorer - doing planetary surveys
- Corporate Magnate - setting up outposts, mining, and manufacturing facilities
- Scavenger - I did this for a short time on a new play through but it ran out of gas quickly
- Space cowboy - [Firefly](Firefly.md)'s intro
- UC Vanguard Captain: Join UC Vanguard and complete missions given by Commander Tuala.
- UCSYSDEF: Join UC Vanguard and complete some missions to get an invite to UCSYSDEF or get caught with contraband while entering UC Space (only works after initiating Constellation Questline) and then accept offer from UCSYSDEF and complete missions given to you by Commander Ikande.
- Pirate - Join the Crimson Fleet by turning down offer from UCSYSDEF and waiting to get an offer to join or accept offer from UCSYSDEF aand choose to join the Fleet when it is offered the complete missions from the Crimson Fleet mission board.
- Smuggler - Transport smuggled goods to settled planets and sell them to local Trade Authority or join the Crimson Fleet and complete Smuggling missions from the Crimson Fleet mission board.

^Essentially all of these only access a small part of the game. Where as in TES or Fallout, you role indicates how they interact with the content, not what content they exclusively do.

Serpent's Embrace lore clashes with Kid Stuff - Your parent' will still be well adjusted recent retirees with no sense of being from a Cult.
