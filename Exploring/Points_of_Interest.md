I have found the same cave interior twice now, one on the Moon and another on Earth, it is a bit disappointing to see how limited the variations are.

Zero gravity casino space station in the Olympus station - Awesome! Great little dungeon. No gravity, so the movement and fighting was refreshing, and it had some hidden secrets like finding a jackpot code to enter into the backend system to cash out some credits. Finally, something that really takes advantage of the fact that we’re in space in the future. Interior was designed like a set from the SW prequels too, lovely and shiny. Wish more of the game looked like this.

Oh the joys or random POIs placed with abandon. POIs highlighted on the planet overview screen where you scan the surface from do not seem to have any uniqueness placed upon them as some on Reddit have claimed. This Civvie outpost seems as random as the rest of them, with a generic radiant quest to boot.

Higher-level universes unlock more POIs, some that have more dynamic situations, like this Deserted Colony War Barracks, which was filled with pirates. When I attacked, a squadron of opportunistic Spacers landed in two ships nearby and joined in, resulting in a 1v1v1 war. 
Locking POIs behind [levelled](Progression.md) areas is understandable, as you want players to discover more the more you play, but by limiting the early game pool to such a low amount, people will feel like they've seen all the game has to show in a few hours. Made even worse is how 90% of the MQ and Faction Quests take place on the left side of the [Star-System_Map](Star-System_Map.md), in Star Systems below Level 30.

The Colander Space Dungeon is a reference to an alien. Space Dungeons are generally some of the best in the game. Most of the Dungeons are pretty good in design, actually - especially with the new Vents for stealth builds (ignoring how massive said vents are).

Random POIs started back in Oblivion with the Oblivion Gates. There are fewer oblivion maps than portals that open, so you _will_ see repeats. 7 randomized maps, but 60 gates per game.
The only fixed portals are the scripted city portals, a couple of quest portals that still use one of the maps from the random list.

POI's are level locked and for some reason the RNG when generating POI's favours a few over all the others. Which sucks, especially early game. But downloading a mod like POI cool down helps reduce the amount of repeat POI's you get over a certain amount of time.

Some dungeons are very much ‘Fallout in space’ in tone, this space station has a rogue MAST scientist using human subjects to experiment xeno-digestion - how long can a human survive inside an alien’s stomach. It’s 16 hours apparently. Other scientists highlight their concerns in other computer entries and email logs. (Still can’t get over how amateur this [interface](HUD+UI.md) is).

Planets should either be empty or thriving.
Not this weird.. oh its inhospitable and uninhabited but here's Timmy and his wind farm. Why.
Why is there a wind farm here? What wind. What is it powering.
