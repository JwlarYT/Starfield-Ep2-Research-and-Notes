The proc gen does have some inevitable graphical glitches associated with it. Tiles don’t line up, and shadows may end abruptly. It is to be expected, sometimes the tiles don’t line up well in the hand-made Elder Scrolls games either.

Forest biomes are far more tranquil to explore than the barren moon-like worlds - no surprise. The diversity of the biomes on [Jemison](Cities/New_Atlantis.md) is impressive.

I wish the game had been designed so that planetary exploration was encouraged. That the huge map tiles connected to each other, and as you transition from one tile it loads the next. So that instead of planets being made up from thousands of unconnected tiles, you’d have actual travel possible.
	Doesn't matter in Starfield as it is, it would add nothing.

#### Landing Zones
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfU4ZWtiAng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfU4ZWtiAng) 

It took me 21:12 minutes to run from the eastern edge of a landing zone to the western edge.

I was around 4.6km away from my ship at the eastern edge of the map and around 3.3km away from my ship at the western edge (as per the scanner).

So if we assume that each landing zone tile is 8km across, that makes them each 64 sq km or 9.22 sq miles. That's around the size of Cyrodiil in Oblivion (which is 57 sq km). Except that has 350 locations and a landing zone has around 6-10.

Islands in the proc-gen algo. Hard to find many of these different possibilities due to how wide spread they are.

[How Starfield Filled Its Galaxy with Alien Life](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/02/28/how-starfield-filled-its-galaxy-with-alien-life/)
Xbox Wire, Mile Nelson, Feb 2024

“The original rules for planet generation were put together and used to create a massive spreadsheet of all the stars and planets in the game,” explains Senior System Designer Sam Combs. “Data like the distance of planets from the star, the type of atmosphere and magnetosphere, the size of the planet, the presence of water, and the biomes and traits on the planet, all determined the likelihood of flora and fauna being found there.”

“Although not scientific in its distribution, this does at least mirror the only solar system any of us have experience with,” explains Lead Character Artist Ben Carnow.
“I do not believe that a true unifying theory for life distribution is a thing that we really touched on in Starfield. I think, as in real life, the origins of life in Starfield are intended to be mysterious. I have always found the theory of [Panspermia](Presentation/Panspermia.md) intriguing, that the building blocks of life (bacteria etc.) are present in many places and have been spread over billions of years by things like comets or other interstellar cataclysms.”

“Creatures are cool, and we wanted lots of them,” Lead Tech Artist Felipe Nogueira shares. “Leadership had an idea of what percentage of planets would need life, and we went from there. In the end, we ended up with upwards of 200 different creature meshes split amongst the different archetypes.”

During concepting, they produced dozens of silhouettes to create a diverse pool of alien creatures. Each of these concepts were grounded in realism by studying real creatures from our planet, while taking note of how diverse our own ecosystem is.
“Our next step was to identify archetypes from our visual exploration,” Nogueira details. “Our goal was to select the best variety of body types to fill specific roles in our substantial number of planets and biomes. This led to us selecting setups such as quadrupeds, octopedes, hexapods, flying and floating creatures, and many others. In the end, we created **15 base archetypes** to build from.”

“We also had to consider which biomes they appeared in – if a creature only appeared in one, less common biome, they would be much harder to find and scan than if they appeared in multiple biomes,” explains Combs. “Having a manageable number of creatures that the player was required to find to complete a planet survey was a consideration. The density of creatures spawned is also controlled by the biome – some have higher density where it makes sense.”

**Fauna is not proc-gen:**
“We considered creating a library of creature parts that could be mixed and matched to produce a variety of life early on in Starfield production,” Carnow explained. “However, we discarded the idea because it could not produce the fidelity of creatures we wanted. A mix and match system can produce some cool and unexpected results, but it tends to work better in more stylized games. So, every one of the close to 200 creatures in Starfield was built as a unique piece of art, and nothing is piecemeal.”

“We have different behavior sets, combat styles, and attack and defense mods we assign to each creature. The biggest difference is between predators and prey,” Combs shares. “The body type and visuals were helpful for determining which creature behaviors to assign. For example, an aggressive-looking spider with fangs would make more sense visually as a predator, while a more docile pig-like creature would make more sense as prey. Larger creatures were made tougher, and if they looked like they had natural armor, there was a better chance of them being assigned a higher damage resistance.”

“If every biped the player encounters is an aggressive predator, and every quadruped is a foraging herbivore, it shrinks the player’s expectations and makes the worlds less interesting to explore,” Carnow shares. “We tried to determine the behavior of each creature based on the look of its anatomical structure. There is a lot of wiggle room however, as we did not want everything with pointy teeth to be a predator for example. Nature should be surprising.”

“The immense number of creatures was the largest challenge from the design side, more so than any individual creature,” Combs explains. “Getting them distributed among the planets in a way that made sense, and modular enough that they could be assigned different behaviours on different planets without seeming too similar, was a challenge. The Terrormorph was one of the most complex that got the most screentime, and required a team of artists, animators, programmers, and designers to get the unique behaviours working.”

“Designing flying creatures that feel believable and look alien was (also) a challenge for us,” says Nogueira. “The main difficulty was to make them look different from each other while having to incorporate specific features such as wings, which from a distance can make them all appear the same.”

“We created interesting, engaging, and visually impressive fauna on hundreds of worlds that interact with the player and each other in interesting ways,” says Combs. “I would say we got close to what we wanted. There is always more you wish you could do – I still wish you could tame the creatures and build a zoo or have a pet Ashta follow you around, for example.”

Knowing now the incredible level of care and attention to detail that went into creating these planets, and hand placing each of the alien creatures we discover, has made the entire experience of planet hopping in Starfield that much more enticing to continue.
	Unfortunately, I don't think that's true. *People don't care.*
