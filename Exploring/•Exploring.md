I’m completely sucked into the world, and don’t care if I'm wasting an hour bouncing from caves to outposts; it is both relaxing and pleasantly enjoyable in a [“find thing, give dopamine”](Exploring/Skinner_Box.md) kinda way. It isn’t thrilling, but I don’t want to be thrilled 24/7, I’m happy for these relaxing walks - it’s what Bethesda are known for, and one of the reason’s Skyrim is still adored by many to this day imo. Not the mechanics, but the world, and how it meshes with its soundtrack to create an ambience only found in this form of interactive media.
	^ This feeling was temporary. The first few times, amazing. By the fifth time, we’re just repeating the same steps. The atmosphere is still great, but I’m still running around scanning rocks and walking into caves or the odd pirate filled outpost. This form of exploration is a big downgrade from the handmade worlds of Morrowind onwards. It has lost its allure only 20 hours into the game.

Going to location a few KM away in NMS has the player taking a small flight, in Starfield it's a 5 minute jog or pulling out the 300 year old [Mars Rover](../New_Updates/Ground_vehicles.md) tech.

Wandering a planet gets you the same frozen scientific base every time, right down to the names of people in the computers. The same scientists are apparently on multiple [Planets](Presentation/Planets.md), having the same exact experiences, which we then arrive to read about after they're gone/dead. It's weird, like some temporal/spatial loop is happening in the universe or something - except it's actually just lazy copy/paste work.

Was a problem from concept. A galaxy that has mostly been explored as a means of exploring its resources losing the cultural and historical mystery of exploring in TES and FO.

I can appreciate the Daggerfall-ness of the exploration gameplay loop. This is, the more I play it, the only space sim that uses surface combat so well - it’s where it excels. So many other games beat it in [space](../Gameplay_Systems/Space_Gameplay.md) exploration and the space sim-[Role-Playing](../Gameplay_Systems/Role-Playing.md), but none of those can bring with them good dungeon crawling. That’s Starfield’s USP.

Players can remember which dungeons they’ve already cleared and where they sit in the world in the past game. You don’t have that with the dungeons in Starfield. You only remember the ones that imprint on you because you’ve either done them too many times or it was bad. (Cryo Lab).
	Use the first dungeon in Morrowind as an example

Starfield gives me a window into how a cat or dog might feel if they REALIZED they were being fed the same exact thing day in and day out. Yeah, maybe it does genuinely taste good, but at some point you take a step back and go "isn't this what I ate yesterday?" and suddenly it's bland and tasteless by pure repetition.

What makes exploring interesting is finding the unknown. After a few go-arounds interacting with Starfield's exploration loop, the player is left with the feeling that there is no unknown left. They know the game's tricks, and what to expect, and are instead left scanning [Points_of_Interest](Exploring/Points_of_Interest.md) and comparing them to their mental notebook to check if they've experienced that one before. Completely inorganic. In previous titles, you knew if a dungeon was new because you hadn't been to that part of the map before.

#### How exploration is meant to go
The Stafield approximation of the Bethesda formula. 
+ Need to go to a location for a quest, cannot quite reach it in one jump, so you jump to the system in the middle. 
+ Arrive at a planet, scan the planet. If there is a highlighted location on the planet, check it out. 
	+ If not, check out any of the space-based locations from the map - like Starstations or ships. 
	+ Or check out other planets/moons in the system if interested, or simply jump to the location you needed to go in the first place. 

On paper, this journey isn’t too different from previous games. You start running to your location, see an icon on your compass or an interesting feature off the beaten track, and go check it out. It’s how it’s presented to you that matters. 
Skyrim’s compass isn’t as diegetic as Fallout’s affair, but it’s far less intrusive than a massive screen panning [Star-System_Map](../Gameplay_Systems/Star-System_Map.md). 

Navigating the world this way is entirely non-immersive to me. Having the player need to visit the map from a console in their ship (like in KOTOR or Mass Effect) would have been just enough to help tie it together, in my opinion. You can then still have it accessible from the menu for QoL, but at least it’s tied to the world.
	This Star Map module even exists in-game, but we inexplicably cannot interact with it - again, a [mod](Development/Reliance_on_Mods.md) fixed this within a month.

I found an abandoned vessel on the way to [Akila_City](Cities/Akila_City.md) using this intended method, which led to some humorous in-world storytelling of the galaxy's worst pirates and their quick failure. From a gameplay standpoint, it was just an empty ship with loot, but this is the kind of stuff the game needs more of. The problem lies in how this is discovered by the player, not by exploring and stumbling across it, but by clicking the big icon on the map. It simply doesn’t feel like a genuine discovery in the same way previous titles did.

[Sam Coe](../Gameplay_Systems/Companions.md) succinctly explains why exploring should be enthralling (during his Q&A and Backstory). 
'Landing on many inhabitants is uneventful (accurate), but it’s when you find something no one has seen before that makes it feel so powerful.'
Which would be true if the POI designers got that message. Every amazing crystal cave of geological wonder has had a multitude of people see it before, as can be proven by their remains strewn nearby. 
	Or the abandoned lab/hanger/factory, or whatever other dungeon the algo wanted to place a kilometre away. 
Sam explains exactly why Starfield’s planet exploration initially works, until it all comes crashing down due to the poor implementation of its POI feature.

It’s wise to take missions in the same system whenever possible to minimise back-and-forth travel. For example, I have a [Constellation](../Main_Quest/Constellation.md) mission that requires me to identify a specific geographical trait in one system, and I also found another general mission in the same system to hunt pirates. At least it gives me something to do between the mindless scanning. (Said system has like 15 moons/planets too, and the payout is only 3k credits and 250xp - not worth the time investment, even if you enjoy the RP aspect of this play-style).

All the issues people have with Starfield are the same issues that have plagued Bethesda games for years. The main story, and quest-based roleplaying of Oblivion, Fo3, Fo4 and Skyrim aren't great. But role-playing within the mechanics and gameplay loop of the explorable open world is what save them. Starfield strips that for surveying and repeated POIs placed too far away from eachother.

The game relies on encounters from system to system. As you jump from different systems, you will find these "quests", fairly short but unique. It does get exhausting to jump between systems for an hour so you can see something new.

So, jump to the system, check map icons, land, oops done this. Go back to space, jump system, repeat.

Wish you could scan nearby systems for "distress calls" or beacons or resources, points of interest, etc. I hate warping blind. Would make the [Star-System_Map](../Gameplay_Systems/Star-System_Map.md) exploration a little more interesting.
