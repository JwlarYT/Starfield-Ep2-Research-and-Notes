The level designers have outdone themselves with the level of clutter. These locations truly feel lived in, and those like myself who enjoy ransacking every room for loot will be in heaven. 

The [scanner](Surveying.md) is another god-send here. It highlights lootable objects in blue, reminiscent of Outer Worlds, but unlike that game, this is an optional feature hidden behind the scanner. 

If you want to peruse every locker and book case the old school way as in FO and TES, you can do so. But if you want to streamline the experience, the scanner is highly appreciated.

Environmental storytelling is weak in some of the dungeons. The reliance on text-based slates and computer emails lacks the gravitas of Fallout’s voice notes, but it’s on a similar level to Skyrim. 
Some are very depressing, and hit me more than I expected, like [finding](•Exploring.md) an [abandoned ship](Points_of_Interest.md) floating in space, only to find a recently deceased couple. Based on the notes left, they had lost their daughter to an illness, and the mother committed suicide soon after, leaving the father to do the same a day later.

Vents in dungeons inspired by Half Life 2, but with comically scaling to accommodate the [Creation_Engine](Creation_Engine.md)’s limitations.
