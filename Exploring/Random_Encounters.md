[Todd's](Research/Todd_Howard_Interviews.md) comments on emergent storytelling are ringing home. When I landed on the moon, a damaged spaceship flew overhead, making a forced landing nearby. I ran to it, expecting some pirates and my first look at stealing a ship, only for some friendly NPCs to emerge asking for help. I inquired, and found them to be trusting enough, so I forced them to pay me 3000 credits for the parts they needed to fix the ship (in my defense, they were my only ones, so I cannot repair my own ship until I buy more either).

I wonder how often these kinds of random encounters will repeat over a standard playthrough? Or are there enough that I will never see a repeat?
	I will see them repeat ad-nauseum it turns out.

I was chased by pirates and had to [grav jump](Exploring/Travelling.md) to a nearby desolate planet, the only one in its solar system, dominated by a huge red dwarf star. This was the planet I chose to use for my landing zone tests yesterday.
	It’s a lonely barren place, with only a single abandoned relay system as proof of human activity. The marketing was correct in that the loneliness of space can certainly be felt, I must admit that without the random encounter with the horde of high level pirates that forced me to this system, I would have never come here. It is moments like this that not many games can create, yet they have been present in Bethesda titles for decades.
		Just today on stream while playing Fallout 4, a similar scenario occurred where I was being chased by an Alpha Deathclaw, and I had to run to a nearby building to take shelter until he gave up his pursuit. A different outcome, but a similar scenario in how the game set it up.

Space random encounters will glitch out if you hail them before they contact you, causing a dialogue loop. (Narcissus Race)

#### Ship Landings
Ships will often land nearby to grab the player's attention. 
It appears to be a 50/50 chance that this will be a hostile faction or a friendly ship requesting supplies or ship parts to aid in their repairs. I would’ve liked to see a few ship crashes to spice things up, showing what happens to those damaged ships that don’t make it. 
Even let the player shoot at the landing ships to cause them to crash - FO3 and 4 had this feature with Vertibirds.
We already have crashed ship [POIs](Exploring/Points_of_Interest.md) as well, if you placed the ship crashing animation sequence far enough away, it would be possible to have this animation spawn the POI in an estimated position where it crashed. I assume that this was probably attempted during development and abandoned due to the age-old reasoning that it would take too much time or money.

A [Varuun](Factions/Varuun.md) Zealot ship invaded a random Civilian Outpost [POI ](Exploring/Points_of_Interest.md)but the whole encounter was an anticlimax. The ship set down, offloaded the passive NPCs and flew away. The Zealots didn’t make a beeline for the civilian NPCs or anything, just strolled in a passive state until they saw me, at which time they became hostile. On paper, it looked like a good idea, but it didn't work in execution.

An [Ecliptic](Factions/Ecliptic.md) Mercenary ship landed nearby me on a planet, and I was able to apprehend it and make it my own. It wasn’t significantly better than my vanilla ship, so I decided to sell it. 
[Piracy](../Gameplay_Systems/Piracy.md) - However, to do so, I had to register it first, which cost around 80% of its value. As a result, when I did sell it, I received only a $2,000 profit from an $8,000 value item. Not a great trade-off, and makes piracy less appealing, in my opinion.

Random encounters (and the [Points_of_Interest](Exploring/Points_of_Interest.md) system) are tied to the level of the [star system](../Gameplay_Systems/Star-System_Map.md). As players will spend the first 20-40 hours in systems under level 30, the same encounters crop up, leading to this feeling of having seen everything the game has to offer, and what it has to offer is very limited. Upon exploring deeper, there are more encounters, and they also provide greater variety. 
+ In low level star systems a landing ship indicated a stranded crew needing parts or water, or a ‘bandit’ encounter with pirates, mercs etc. In a level 30 system, the ship was posing as a random [Freestar_Collective](Factions/Freestar_Collective.md) vessel, but after boarding, I met the captain, who assumed I was the contact for a smuggling drop off he was making. 
	+ I chose to accept the package, a high-tier spacesuit, and then kill him and the crew to stop any leads (he warned me if I did not deliver the suit in time, ‘they’ would find me). Seeing as I wasn’t the contact, of course I cannot deliver the suit, so I’m looking forward to any follow-up on this if there is one.
		^ I got the follow up! Some [Ecliptic ](Ecliptic%20)mercs grav drived in [space](../Gameplay_Systems/Space_Gameplay.md) and accosted me, asking for 10k in credits or they will attack. 
		They were only level 20 so I took them out. The issue was that they said they knew I stole the package because the smuggler told them… the one I killed… 
			How hard was it to keep it cryptic and say that they have been chasing my ship's signature data? We already know that satellites and other ships store that info from the [The_Old_Neighborhood](../Main_Quest/The_Old_Neighborhood.md). Unless, of course, the radiant quest designer wasn't aware of this... due to [Poor_Planning](Development/Poor_Planning.md).
