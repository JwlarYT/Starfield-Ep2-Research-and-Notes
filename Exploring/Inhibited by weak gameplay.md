I saw this on reddit:

*"The Settled Systems already are the New Caribbean with pirates, but it should have also been the ideological frontier where all the sociological experimentation can take place and where sci-fi genre can truly shine. We should have seen messy, volatile, colonies and systems bursting with varied ideological experiments some more successful than others. We should have seen sci-fi case studies!"*

You know what's funny. We do see these. Starstations and abadoned POIs contain these very stories or Xenobiology and horrific human studies gone wrong. Yet no one sees it. Because identifying with black and white diamond icon is uniuqe content that fulfills this, and which is a a dungeon you've cleared 3 times before is unclear until you've already wasted precious time making the journey there. 

I suspect if you had the notes the developers and writers were working off for the factions and their locations, they would match exactly what that redditor is  suggesting under “Factions should mean something”.

In fact, they do largely resemble what you suggest but it all falls flat and comes off as flat, bleached, uninteresting, and boring.
Even the dystopias you mention I had really overlooked or forgotten because they seem like tiny microcosms.

You’re right about no conflict or risk - it feels like a Disney set that wants to be inclusive of everyone and everything without offending anyone.

*A comment asks : "I agree that starfield is in desperate need of ideological conflicts."*

Again, it has them, but they so pushed down into singular voice lines and a museum presentation. 

Clearly, if this many people are unaware of this content, that is problem from Bethesda. The lore is too hidden away from the majority, that they are asking for stuff that is already there.
	Goes back to what Shen said about side content sometimes being the best stuff in the game as it isn't adhering to the 'main themes' espoused by Todd and co.
