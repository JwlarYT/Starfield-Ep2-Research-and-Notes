We had a conversation on stream about what actually is a modern Bethesda game (meaning Skryim onwards). What do the fans actually want out of these games?

When you look at what quite a large proportion of the (PC) audience see in these games, Bethesda to them doesn't make games, they make highly customisable sandboxes. 

Starfield isn’t a game about [Artifacts](../Main_Quest/Artifacts.md), the [United_Colonies](../Factions/United_Colonies.md), [Crimson_Fleet](../Factions/Crimson_Fleet.md) or any of that. It’s a brand new space-based [Sandbox](.md) where modders can use the familiar user-friendly creation kit to go wild. Where gamers can customise the sandbox to become the space game of their dreams.

More importantly, does Bethesda *know* that? I think it’s not only clear that they do, but that it has become a crutch to them. Anything that is lacking or ‘mid’ will be improved by the community. New features will be added that make the game better. And what will people do when they learn of these oh-so-cool Starfield mods that make the game into Star Wars, or Elite with ground combat, or whatever other space franchise they want? They will buy Starfield. Because Starfield is the base sandbox they need to run those mods.

*Bethesda isn’t in the gaming industry, they're in the [modding tools](../Development/Reliance_on_Mods.md) industry - and they know it.

The game only has to be “good enough” to ignite the modder’s imagination.
	**And for many of them - it *wasn't!* 

This is as much sandbox game as it is an RPG, it’s strongest suits actually allign more so to role-playing within the Sandbox, than they do to role-playing within the role-playing content.
