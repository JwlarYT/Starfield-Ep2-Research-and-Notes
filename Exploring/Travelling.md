[Loading_Screens](Loading_Screens.md) are at their worst in space. Without real-time meaningful space travel (it’s possible, but slow and doesn’t even load in the next planets properly), it’s entirely normal to go through 3 cutscenes and another 5-6 loading screens when travelling between planets. Not a seamless experience by any means - just a load of menu jumping. Even when leaning into the so-called ‘[immersive](Immersion.md)’ approach of ignoring the menu system and using the scanner and targeting systems to travel in-game, one still has to stare at cutscenes and loading screens rather than flying a ship. (Time how long watching vs. playing) 

This ‘[immersive](Immersion.md)’ flying choice falls apart quickly when you approach one of the three main planets, though. Here I am cycling through the numerous surrounding ships, trying to get [New_Atlantis](New_Atlantis.md) to appear… until I give up and load the map, which suggests that I should fast travel straight to the lodge and ignore any attempt to land in an immersive way. Bethesda doesn’t want us to be immersed in their space-faring game with this design.

At points, I wonder why the game section of space was even needed. Just let us straight up fast travel to another planet without this lull in between. Or lean more into a KOTOR/Mass Effect style, with more emphasis on the ship interior and interactions with the crew. Then again, NPC writing isn’t exactly Bethesda’s strong suit, so it’s probably for the best that space travel isn’t a forced means of interacting with them. 

#### Flying
You can fly to planets; it just takes [7 hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3cHBEWN3xI) to do so.
Needs a mod that will: 
	- Calculate a landing coordinate once the player gets too near a planet 
	- transitions to the landing sequence
Essentially, how Elite Dangerous handles it.

Why didn't BGS add this themselves?
	Because the game was too ambitious, adding more content would lead to more problems, including even the optimisation of this game being worse than Cyberpunk.

The technical aspect of landing, including being unable to fly on the surface and transitioning to space, is a shame. 

When boarding a landed pirate ship, it took off and transitioned to space in a 1-second loading screen. This isn’t ideal compared to games like Elite and NMS, instead working closer to Star Wars: Elite Squadron on the underpowered PSP, but it works. You can transition to space in a minor loading screen, no long-winded cutscene needed. Seeing as we can fly on the surface using the car, these were all design decisions, not technical. At one point, they may have attempted to fly along the surface and encountered issues primarily with the landing zone. It’s the size of the ship that would be a problem. The car is small enough to work.

#### Why forgo fast travel?
In past BGS titles, the answer to this question was refreshingly straightforward: skipping fast travel meant unlocking an organic adventure.

Every trek between a quest giver and the desired destination offered the potential for discovery — be it another dungeon, an unexpected encounter, a rogue bandit camp, or a spontaneous side quest. The journey _was_ the content. Add in the ambience, environmental storytelling, and a beautiful soundtrack, and suddenly that quick errand became a two-hour game session-defining saga.

It’s that combination of exploration and serendipity that makes BGS games so beloved — the sense that you’re not just playing a story, you’re _creating_ one.

In Starfield, that journey has been impaired.

[Dungeons](Points_of_Interest.md) get diluted across a sprawling void of procedurally generated planets. [Side_Quests](Side_Quests.md)? Rarely does a distressed outpost within the Star System radio in a distress call if we're lucky, but in my experience, it happened only 4 times, and one of those was a scripted moment in the Main Quest.

As for the [atmosphere](Immersion.md)? Unless you find staring at a static skybox with a PNG of a planet riveting, the sheer wonder of [•Exploring](•Exploring.md) space sadly falls flat unless you enjoy the same five or so short transition cutscenes.

Grav jumps? Automatic cutscene and load screen. Navigating between celestial bodies? Also automated. What used to be a 2-hour adventure filled with possibilities now stretches to maybe 10 minutes — and that’s if you're poking around deliberately, flying to the highlighted POIs in the local Star System. And still, much of that time is spent bouncing from one space sandbox to another, hoping for something unscripted to happen.

It usually doesn’t.

Space encounters are rare. And when they _do_ happen, they’re often not engaging enough to justify the drag. There’s a fundamental problem here — an unspoken disrespect for the player’s time.

In Starfield, fast travel isn’t just a convenience. It’s a mercy.

This is the biggest failure of this game. Every planet or moon within 30 LY is only a loading screen away. It completely eliminates the vastness of space and turns it into a fast travel grid. In any game I play that allows fast travel, I never use it as I prefer the more immersive mode of travel. Yet, in this game, it’s the only way to travel.
