Quests are unlocked as you [level](Progression.md), with guards making you aware of new ones. News broadcasts through SSN pillars in the main [•Cities](•Cities.md) also do the same, and help add some extra life through diegetic lore.

‘Activities’ often take the player to the start of a misc quest (side quest).

I dislike that you cannot tag multiple quests to track, as in Skyrim and FO4. It’s either track one quest or track them all—no in between.

Random cops exposit or say things like, "I shouldn't be telling you this, but..." or "You didn't hear this from me, but..." as you pass them. I can halfway understand a regular civilian, but law enforcement? How do you conduct investigations when sensitive information is being openly disclosed? 
	...Eavesdropping from a certain distance as they talk on the radio or hacking their communications would be too engaging, I guess?

Enhance! owner lost confidential documents and asked us to find them but not read them. With such emphasis you would expect another game to give you the choice to read them as a means of blackmailing him, or maybe going to the SSN Network and leaking his lack of secure privacy. Here the only option is to hand it back to him. Another basic fetch quest with no twists or turns - the lack of creativity is astounding. It screams content for the sake of content. Like the quest design team were assigned a number of quests they had to hit and they stopped caring how good they were long ago as long as the number went up.

The Galbank questline works like a proto-tracker's alliance, but killing isn’t necessary. (And may be punished).

Quests do have cute little follow ups, like Styx the Mech in [Neon_City](Neon_City.md) getting a new paint job and upgrade after we took out the Disciple gang member responsible for graffiti tagging him.
Mostly adds a new voice line or two, but at least there’s some extra payout past the immediate reward. Helps the world feel a little more alive.

Start of Walter's 'Overdesigned' quest behind the curtain look at Starfield’s planning problems? 
“R&D is a natural starting point, we look at what we’ve done before and analyse data on how best to proceed, but everyone’s confirmation bias changes what they think is necessary”.

A good amount of those are basically glorified radiants with a fixed spot. Like the special ingredient pickup for that one chunks location that is just an excuse to make you see the ECS Constant and start the real quest.
	A single step above a radiant. Perhaps to help those [Radiant_Quests](Radiant_Quests.md) stand out less?

That would be a cool idea. I really liked 'Juno's Gambit' also. I think it showcases Starfield at its best in those more thoughtful moments.

Most of my favourite side quests in Starfield are the ones that involve little or no combat but emphasise quirky scenarios, relationships, and characters.

Unfortunately, it is the very definition of quantity over quality. While each city does contain over 5 side quests each, many are one and done affair that take 5 minutes to complete and often break down into minor disputes between 2 NPCs that can only be solved by speech.
