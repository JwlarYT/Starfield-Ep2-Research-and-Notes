Perfect example of how Bethesda quests lack the choice/options/role-playing opportunities 

An overexcited scientist has found readings that indicate a potential health hazard to the residents of [New_Atlantis](New_Atlantis.md) is coming. (Low frequency waves from the Trees, that may cause headaches and nausea, and eventually grow to mimic seismic activity, destroying the city).

To ensure that he is right, [MAST](MAST.md) have sent a second scientist to confirm these readings. However, the second scientist holds a grudge against the first, has a superiority complex and is terrible at his job. His data will likely be false and deny the first scientist’s claim.

The first scientist asks us to retrieve the data from the second one so that he can show the people at [MAST](MAST.md) the truth. The second scientist will only give you the data if you: 

1. delete his personal records (which show unfavorable employee reviews - he is an insufferable guy, who is bad at his job after all) from the MAST computer network. 
2. Pass a [persuade check](Progression.md) asking him to give them to you. 
3. Or you can threaten him.

So we have 3 basic choices. 

But, why can’t I tell someone at [MAST](MAST.md) about his plan. Or better yet, do something to the records he has asked me to wipe that will get him fired.

The files are held on a computer in a lead scientist’s apartment. You must break into the apartment to delete them. I entered the room and decided to wait for them to come home - NPCs should have [NPC routines](NPC%20routines.md) right? Well, they never come home. I waited multiple hours across the day and night and they’re never to be seen - so you can never tell her of what is happening.

All you can do is delete the files as asked. You can also delete the unfavourable reviews for the first scientist for some brownie points.

Deleting only the first scientist’s review and leaving the second’s one does nothing. The quest does not proceed and the NPCs will not acknowledge what you have done.
